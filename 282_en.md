Two people appeared with a thunderous noise.

I waved my hand towards the familiar face.

"Oh, damn, you're here."

I thought about giving that jerk a punch in the face, but when I saw his distorted expression, I couldn't help but smirk.

I looked disappointedly at Park Ji-hoon's clenched fist and asked with a mocking expression.

"You didn't come empty-handed, did you?"

"What?"

"Melona."

"This bastard..."

A large hand grabbed the shoulder of the blushing guy.

"You still have a lot to learn."

Park Ji-hoon bit his lip and took a step back.

Looking at me as if finding it amusing, the middle-aged man who had bitten everyone nearby spoke.

"Do you know who I am?"

I nodded my head. It was a face that couldn't be unknown.

With the weight of his name and frequent appearances in media such as newspapers and magazines.

"Park Tae-seop, the guild master of Myeongdong."

A war hero who played an active role in the great upheaval, one of the top-ranked players in the country.

He was a dream and a respected senior to hunters.

"I used to respect him too.

But not anymore.

My good memories of Park Tae-seop expired two days ago.

Thoughts manifest in attitudes. In my gaze, filled with obvious animosity, Park Tae-seop spoke up.

"So you see me as an enemy."

"I can't consider you a friend, can I? Given the circumstances."

"Don't jump to conclusions. In life, you realize that there are neither eternal friends nor enemies."

"That's debatable. I'm not so sure about the idea of no eternal enemies."

Speaking while looking at Park Ji-hoon standing beside me.

"The idea of no eternal friends definitely has some merit."

Park Ji-hoon retorted with a cold voice.

"Your premise is wrong. We were never friends."

"We were never friends."

I leaned back in my chair, pondering his words.

Until now, there was one thing I couldn't understand: Park Ji-hoon's sudden change in attitude.

But...

"Well, what does it matter at this point? It's already over since the Black Hunter was sent."

Black Hunter. As the sensitive word came up, Park Tae-seop clenched his fist.

The hundred or so hunters who filled the corridor as per the guild master's orders dispersed like water.

I heard the fading footsteps and raised the corners of my mouth.

"You're not very confident."

"Because of my mistake."

"You're frank to the point of being pathetic."

"I also personally feel ashamed."

"For someone who feels ashamed, you gave quite a despicable order."

"What's the reason?"

A hint of discomfort flashed across Park Tae-seop's face. But it wasn't directed towards me.

For a brief moment, his gaze fell on Park Ji-hoon standing beside him before retreating.

"Look at this..."

The actions Park Tae-seop showed now were not intentional.

If such actions came out unconsciously, there must be something he was hiding.

I recalled the unclear parts that had bothered me all along and pondered.

"The foul stench vibrates, it vibrates.
At that moment, Park Ji-hoon suddenly spoke up.

"To restrain you, the Peace Guild."

"Restrain?"

"When a new strong force appears, it means someone's share of the pie diminishes. It's not just us, other guilds must be thinking the same, right?"

At first glance, it makes sense.

The domestic guild market is already oversaturated. There are divisions and rankings. The existing top dogs don't want any new competitors.

"The Peace Guild is dangerous. Although it is currently limited to Bucheon, it will soon grow rapidly and increase its influence."

"So, you sent the Black Hunter?"

"I did send them. But didn't I say it was just a warning?"

"I think I said the same thing. But because of that ridiculous warning, someone became disabled."

"Disabled? Attaching prosthetic arms will take time, but it won't hinder everyday life. Is that what they call disabled these days?"

"Well, it's practically the same. One person's hunter life has come to an end."

"Being lower is better than the guild's demise."

"Hmm?

Park Ji-hoon chuckled.

"We've only just begun. The higher gates worth exploring in your guild have already been sealed off, and you'll slowly wither away in the rejection of surrounding guilds."

Suddenly, a memory from a few days ago came to mind.
Team Leader Choi's words about other guilds seizing all the Grade 4 gates.
As a result, I was forced to lead newcomers and couldn't gain any significant experience. I had to settle for Grade 7 or Grade 8 gates.

"Could it be true?"

"It seems dull. Did you think it was a coincidence?"

Park Ji-hoon's lips curled into a smirk. He seemed completely composed, even showing a relaxed posture leaning against the sofa.

"We've recently recruited a large number of guild members. What will you do? If things continue like this, we'll have to let them go within a year. It would be fortunate if we don't get sued for not providing allowances."

I loosened my arms, which had been crossed.

"You're quite capable. Not just any large guild."

"Well, I guess so."

"But... we also have a good hand. If we can expose the crimes committed by the criminals gathered by the Myeongdong Guild, it would be interesting. What do you think?"

Before waiting for Park Ji-hoon's reaction, I continued speaking.

"If we hand over the evidence to the police, you guys will seize the opportunity. But it would be interesting to play a truth game on live streaming through YouTube."

"YouTube? Live streaming?"

"Yeah, that's right. Didn't we create our guild channel? You should subscribe and hit the like button. Don't forget to turn on notifications."

"Oh, right now we have 300,000 subscribers. If we explode this time, it will reach 10 million. Probably half of the South Korean population will watch."

The smile that had been on Park Ji-hoon's lips disappeared abruptly.

"It's better not to get involved in something we can't handle."

"There's nothing we can't handle."

"Do you want to turn all the major guilds against us?"

"If I shatter things here, we can fix them. Can you handle it?"

Park Ji-hoon's lips pressed tightly together, as if to contain his anger.

After staring at me with fiery eyes for a while, the guy uttered a few words.

"Tell me what you want."

"What I want?"

"I'll accommodate as much as possible. Let's negotiate around this point without raising it any further."

"So, a negotiation."

"It could end up as a win-win situation. You should know that as

 well, right?"

It's a valid point. If it were something I could take responsibility for alone, I would push forward to the end, but the lives of many people associated with the Peace Guild are at stake here.
Someone's friend, lover, family... even their future.

I pursed my dry lips quietly.

"What can you offer?"

"Money and power. And various privileges that allow the Peace Guild to grow."

"Didn't you say you sent the Black Hunter because you were troubled by the Peace Guild's growth?"

"That's why we need to draw a line."

"Don't step beyond the designated fence?"

"That's right."

As I continued to listen to Park Ji-hoon's words, a rough picture started to form in my mind.

Currently, there was a significant price to pay in exchange for overlooking the prisoners held captive by the Peace Guild and seeking a resolution to this matter.

No, it could be described as immense.

In addition to transferring ownership of buildings, land, and the exclusive rights to the top gate held by the Myeongdong Guild, there was also a substantial amount of cash involved.

The overall picture looked good. However... 

"The most important thing is missing."

"What did you just say?"

"The most important thing is missing."

"Are you crazy? You're demanding more here?"

"To be honest, even if you explain it to me, I wouldn't understand. I only know that it has great value, but whether it's advantageous or not, that's something our guild leader or Team Leader Choi, who are experts in this, would know."

"So, what exactly is missing?"

I stared silently at Park Ji-hoon.

Sena

"Um..."

"What do you mean by saying an apology is missing if you've made a mistake?"

His proposal had flashy conditions, but there was no apology.

What disappeared was something that should have been given priority.

Me:

Park Ji-hoon burst into laughter. His eyes scanned me up and down, revealing a mix of incredulity and anger.

"Fine. I'm sorry. Is that enough?"

"That's not how you apologize."

Thud.

The sound of Park Ji-hoon's fist hitting something echoed in the air.

But that was only for a moment. After taking a deep breath, he looked into my eyes and spoke in a steady rhythm.

"I'm sorry."

"At least that's something."

"Is it over now?"

I nodded my head slightly.

"Instead, when you do it directly next time, do it with more sincerity. Bow your head politely as well."

"What kind of nonsense is this again?"

"If I were to receive an apology from you, what would I do with it? It should be given to the victims and their families."

Park Ji-hoon's eyelids trembled.

"You expect me to apologize to a Level 1 Hunter right now?"

"Why? Can't you do it?"

"For that part, compensation will be paid in the form of consolation money. It's an amount that most hunters wouldn't be able to touch in their lifetime."

"Well, that works out. It would be more effective to deliver a sincere apology along with a significant amount of consolation money that embodies remorse."

"You..."

Softly, I added a few words, gently directed towards Park Ji-hoon, who was glaring at me with a fierce gaze.

"If your pride is hurt, bring one more person with you to apologize together."

Quietly listening to our conversation, Guild Master Park Tae-seop of the Myeongdong Guild pursed his lips.

"I'll go and apologize in person. With all sincerity."

"At least the Guild Master has some basic manners. You could say he's a clean piece of shit, relatively speaking."

Clean shit. At this moment, is there a more appropriate and paradoxical expression?

However, the other suspect I had in mind was not Park Tae-seop.

Leaving the chair I had been anticipating, I turned my back and looked into Park Ji-hoon's eyes as I spoke.

"The person who gave you the instructions. Bring that person along to apologize as well."

Shhh...

In his eyes, an unmistakable wave surged, even if only for a brief moment.

"Fine. Since Guild Master Park Tae-seop also agreed just now."

Park Ji-hoon spoke in the calmest tone possible.

"I'll go with you and apologize."

"Cut the bullshit. Bring him here."

"I don't know what you're talking about."

With a silent laugh, I took a step forward towards Park Ji-hoon, who was sitting on a guest sofa.

"No matter how much I think about it, it just doesn't make sense."

He slumped down on the opposite side.

I slowly raised my gaze over the large wooden table and observed the figure pretending to be Taeyeon.

A sturdy physique and muscles visible through the shirt. And I sensed a crouched power within.

Big and strong.

Even without checking the levels, it was clear that there was a gap between him and Team Leader 1.

"I don't understand what you mean by not making sense."

"It's incomprehensible that a guy who's strong enough to take down a team leader with one hand is just a regular hunter and not even an assistant team leader."

"Shiai..."

"He's so lazy that he comes to work maybe once a month, and the content of his phone calls with Team Leader 1 is purely personal matters."

There were not just one or two suspicious points.

And as we had this conversation today, my suspicions gradually turned into certainty.

"Despite all the extraordinary conditions going back and forth, the highest authority remains silent while the one speaking is just a regular team member with no position... How am I supposed to accept this, Guild Master Park Tae-seop?"

Guild Master Park Tae-seop, who met my gaze, slightly closed his eyes. That's an excellent poker face.

I smirked as I looked at Park Ji-hoon.

"So, bring him here. I don't know who he is, but bring him and let him apologize."

Park Ji-hoon's tightly sealed lips opened.

"What if I refuse?"

"We'll go all the way."

"You crazy bastard. Who do you think he is?"

"I don't know. I don't particularly care to know. But I'd find some relief if that person comes and apologizes after getting a punch to the head."

Whish!

At the same time, I swiftly raised my hand with blinding speed. Park Ji-hoon activated his security instinct.

"That bastard!"

Crack!

In an instant, our hands collided with a loud thud. In the blink of an eye, we exchanged blows five times.

Thump! The eyes of the guy whose wrist was broken widened.

I slicked back my well-groomed hair and smacked the table.

Bang!

"Like this."
