The limousine raced on the road without any shaking.

Park Ji-hoon, who took out a bottle of water from the refrigerator installed inside, offered it to the elderly man sitting across from him.

"Would you like to have some?"

"In this situation? And where did you learn the habit of offering other people's belongings as if they were yours?"

"Well, then, how about just drinking half of it? I have a stake in the current Myeongdong Guild, so it's okay."

Park Tae-seop, the Myeongdong Guild leader, looked at Park Ji-hoon, who tilted the water bottle without saying a word.

"Quite audacious."

After emptying exactly half of the bottle, Park Ji-hoon sat back in the plush seat and spoke boldly.

"Is there a reason to be concerned?"

"You think it's just a minor hiccup?"

"Sand towers can crumble with just a drop of water."

"Well, that's because they are sand towers."

"But Myeongdong Guild is different, right?"

"We have 500 members, among them 20 are A-class hunters. It's not an exaggeration to say that it's not a sand tower, but an iron tower. And..."

Park Ji-hoon's lips curled up softly.

"Myeongdong Guild should be excluded. 'That person' is there, right?"

"...That's true."

Reluctantly nodding his head, Park Tae-seop wore a discontented expression. Seeing him like that, Park Ji-hoon asked.

"What's the matter? Why are you so restless?"

After a brief silence, Park Tae-seop spoke.

"You develop an inexplicable intuition when you reach my age."

Park Ji-hoon couldn't help but chuckle inwardly. What kind of remark was he going to make? It seemed like the tantrum of an old man who had crossed the age of sixty.

Just a feeling, he said. It wasn't funny at all.

That thought surfaced clearly on his face. And Park Tae-seop, with his experience not short enough to be unaware of that fact, spoke.

"You could think of it as nonsense. I understand. Youngsters like you are unfamiliar with such realms."

"Well, if you feel that way, I apologize."

"That tone of yours, which doesn't convey any sincerity at all, is something only a youngster can do."

"From my perspective, I simply can't understand. What is it that bothers you so much?"

After a short silence, a name popped out.

As if letting out a sigh, it was a name. The name that had been lingering in his mind since the contact with Team 11 was severed.

Just for a moment, I thought it was a slight uneasiness about the distorted situation, but it wasn't.

His intuition, which even discarded major upheavals, provided the answer to this dilemma.

"He's a siege weapon. He can create cracks not only in sand towers but also in iron towers."

Without waiting for a response, Park Tae-seop reached out and picked up the water bottle left by Park Ji-hoon, gulping it down.

As soon as he finished speaking, Park Ji-hoon's throat burned, making it unbearable.

On the other hand, Park Ji-hoon's eyes were creased with concern as he looked at him.

"He showed us the results."

"It hasn't been long since Jin Tae-kyung revealed his abilities."

"Well, he did show a lot in that short time."

"He showed us?"

Park Ji-hoon chuckled, holding back his laughter.

"Won Myung-hoon was nothing but trash. Even among the Rankers, he was a pebble. The only reason his name got mentioned was because of the Hallyu wave. Guild Master, you know that too."

"I heard he was not only stupid and greedy but also packaged his skills as fame."

"And the Named Monster? They call it a Named Monster, but that Black Drake was the weakest among the Named Monsters that appeared in the past 20 years. The power it displayed wasn't much different from a B-rank monster."

"So, do you think you can defeat that weak Named Monster alone?"

"I see no reason why I couldn't."

Park Ji-hoon's response was confident and unwavering.

He had pride in his own abilities.

Thanks to his natural talent, he had the privilege of being chosen by 'that person' and could sit across from the Myeongdong Guild leader at such a young age.

But in the next moment, he couldn't help but hesitate when the next question came.

"If you were to fight against Jin Tae-kyung, are you confident that you would win?"

"...Of course."

This time, his answer was slightly delayed. Park Tae-seop realized that and spoke as he cleared his throat.

"It seems like that moment of hesitation tells us what kind of person Jin Tae-kyung is."

Park Ji-hoon retorted coldly.

"It was just a momentary reminiscence."

"Oh, was he a friend?"

"I don't want to talk about that kid. What I'm trying to say is that this situation is not as serious as you think, Guild Master."

"Team 11 hasn't confirmed their safety yet, and a famous figure who is currently the talk of the town has intruded into the Myeongdong Guild headquarters. Isn't that serious?"

"He's an idiot. So, he recklessly stormed into the Myeongdong Guild headquarters without even defeating a momentary anger."

About ten minutes ago, Park Ji-hoon was having a conversation with the Team 1 leader when he suddenly heard Jin Tae-kyung's voice.

And at the same time, he felt relieved.

"Things will be easily resolved. There are over 500 hunters affiliated with the Myeongdong Guild. Even if half of them are on a raid, an enormous number remained at the headquarters. And of course, the elite Team 1 is among them."

"Jin Tae-kyung has entered the tiger's den. Once we capture him, we can sort out the situation."

Even if journalists try to interfere, there is no need to worry. He, or rather 'that person,' has the power to disable cameras and microphones.

"We'll clean up everything today."

Park Tae-seop mumbled with a stern face.

"It's not a good sign. Is it because I'm getting old that I feel my strength waning?"

"It's just a passing breeze. It would be troublesome if someone who survived even the typhoon called 'Great Cataclysm' were to falter."

Park Tae-seop understood that Park Ji-hoon perceived his words not as encouragement but as criticism. When Park Tae-seop closed his mouth, a monotonous sound of a notification rang from somewhere.

"It's not my phone."

"It's mine."

"Who is it?"

"It's Director Kim, my security supervisor. He asked me to find out what happened to Team 11. It seems like he just arrived."

"Good. First, he told me to erase all traces of Team 11."

"Now he's giving me orders?"

Park Tae-seop looked disgusted as he received the call.

"It's me. What happened? Huh? Oh, I see."

His brow furrowed and then relaxed. His pupils repeatedly dilated and contracted.

Park Tae-seop removed the phone from his ear as his expression became increasingly strange.

"What happened?"

Park Tae-seop handed him his own phone. Veins bulged on his forehead.

"Yes?"

"Hurry up!"

Park Ji-hoon received the phone with a bewildered expression and pressed it against his ear.

Then, a voice as soft as a cat's paw seeped into his ear.

Hunter Park Ji-hoon from Myeongdong Guild Team 1?
Park Ji-hoon realized it as soon as he heard the voice.

The person on the other end of the line was not Director Kim, whom he had encountered several times. The voice was young, polite, yet carried an elusive energy.

"It's me, who is this?"

He had a bad feeling.

In response to Park Ji-hoon's instinctive unease, the unfamiliar voice answered.

My name is Choi Min-woo.
"Who are you?"

Oh, I belong to the Peace Guild. I'm a team leader.
"...Peace Guild?"

- Yes, damn it. Park Ji-hoon's lips trembled.

Just a few words were enough to grasp what had happened. He had fallen neatly into the trap set by the Peace Guild. It was obvious what had happened to Director Kim, the owner of the phone. He was either bound and unconscious or helplessly watching his phone being used.

"Myeongdong Guild, those idiots."

Choi Team Leader's voice from the other end of the receiver sounded leisurely, like that of a winner.

"I called because I wanted to have a conversation."

"Well, um..."

As Park Ji-hoon's mind raced, a vibration came from his chest.

It wasn't Park Tae-seop's phone that he was holding.

- Hunter Park Ji-hoon?

"Just a moment. Hold on."

Park Ji-hoon used his remaining hand to take out his own phone from his suit pocket and checked it.

There was a text message, and the sender was [Team Leader].

It's done.

A relieved smile appeared on Park Ji-hoon's face. It was clear that Jin Tae-kyung, who had entered the tiger's den called Myeongdong Guild, had finally been cornered.

The scale that had tilted in their favor was now balanced.

However...

What??

The smile disappeared from Park Ji-hoon's face as he checked the message.

The 6-inch phone screen was filled with a single image file, not a report from Team Leader Jin Tae-kyung that had captured Jin Tae-kyung.

'What is this?'

Faces that had grown pale.

In the picture, a young man was smiling broadly with a face that had turned into drops of blood. And behind him, an older man clung to him with a pale complexion, as if addicted to drugs.

'Jin Tae-kyung, Team Leader 1?'

But that wasn't all. A familiar background caught his eye behind the two men.

His own nameplate, which read 'Hunter Park Ji-hoon from Myeongdong Guild Team 1,' was a crucial clue that revealed where they were now.

And one more thing.

'Surely... no one could have stopped him?
That bastard Jin Tae-kyung?"

An unwanted reality that he didn't want to believe.

It was the moment Park Ji-hoon's lost gaze wavered.

Buzz.

With the vibration, a new text message arrived. The content was short but intense.

With just five words, it shattered Park Ji-hoon's mental state.

[Sender: Team Leader 1]

Bring Melona when you come.

"You, you fucker...!"

Crack. Park Ji-hoon's phone, which was in his hand, crumpled like a piece of paper.

Watching that sight, Myeongdong Guild Leader Park Tae-seop muttered quietly.

"This is bad."

※ ※ ※

[We have captured the personnel dispatched from Myeongdong Guild.

A text message arrived from Team Leader Choi.

A few hours ago, as we set fire to the secret hideout used by the Black Hunters, we were divided into two paths.

One was the ambush operation to capture solid evidence.
The other was my demand for individual action.

It was all because of Team Leader Choi's argument that we must capture something or someone who could serve as definitive evidence or a witness.

"That's right."

Thanks to meticulous management, including identity laundering for all the Black Hunters, including Im Young-jun, there was no connection to the Myeongdong Guild.

Team Leader Choi was precise in pointing out that fact.

"He's always calm and composed."

Looking back, he never lost his direction.

Kim Jibsa, an outstanding magician and wise advisor, must have played a role in this, but he was born talented, considering the extent of his abilities.

"With this, we have obtained a clear weakness: not only the captured Black Hunters but also the official employees of the Myeongdong Guild."

With this, we will have an excellent shield.

"We can also use it as a dagger."

Along with words praising their hard work, I sent the photo I took earlier.

As expected of an adult's phone, even if you take a picture with your foot, it comes out well. Maybe I should change my phone while I'm at it...

I muttered, and someone flinched. Today, the bodyguard team I hired to protect me all day had no spare moment.

"Why?"

"Oh, no!"

"Please make yourself comfortable. I'll just... be here."

"No matter how I look at it, it seems uncomfortable."

"It's fine."

"It doesn't seem fine at all."

"It's okay!" 

It seemed like a mix of shouts and sobs.

For someone like Grosseur, a security team hunter, it was understandable that he couldn't even focus his eyes properly after single-handedly obliterating the elite 1st team.

"The ones who came later were similar."

The other hunters from Myeongdong Guild who arrived late couldn't dare to challenge me when they saw the scene unfolding before their eyes.

Of course, many of them were armed with strong determination.

But sadly, they lacked skills, and all the ones who attacked me ended up dead.

After knocking down about fifty of them, no one dared to challenge me anymore, and Park Ji-hoon's office became strictly off-limits to anyone.

As I buried my body in the chair he used, I pondered.

"He must be rushing here like a madman right now."

Just thinking about him made my heart chill.

After a long ten years, I coincidentally ran into my middle school classmate on the street.

Where exactly did Park Ji-hoon's true self begin and end?

"Come quickly, before I get angrier.
Bang!

With the strength of my clenched fist, the armrest of the chair broke.

"Oh, you're here!"

"Guild Master!"

The voices echoed through the office door like a wildfire.

At the same time, I felt two powerful energies approaching without hesitation.

"They've arrived."

And in the next moment, with a loud noise, the door burst open.

Crash!
