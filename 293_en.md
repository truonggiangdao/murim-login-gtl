Sigh. Phew!

The hospital room is filled with calm and steady breaths. I stand in front of the door, observing the people who are deeply focused on their training.

At first, they felt a bit awkward, but now they're starting to get the hang of it.

"Hey, Jebeom!"

Team Leader Choe, Master Kim, Song Song-i, and finally, Im Geok-jeong.

Before the sunset, these four accomplished the initial stage of their breakthroughs, and soon enough, they'll be able to perform the Intermediate Breakthrough.

For a start, they're doing pretty well. Actually, even better than I expected. While Team Leader Choe possesses immense power, Kim and Song Song-i, being skilled in magic, quickly adapted to manipulating mana.

But the most surprising progress came from someone unexpected.

It was Im Geok-jeong.

"I thought he would struggle a lot longer... Oh, I almost forgot. Among the people I know, Im Geok-jeong is the only one who has reached the second stage of awakening. Is it because of his relentless efforts or just good luck?"

Whatever the reason, Im Geok-jeong has already surpassed the limitations set upon him.

If they continue to practice and cultivate their skills, their muscles and veins will naturally improve. Once Im Geok-jeong resolves any conscious traumas, he'll be able to rejoin the guild in no time.

"By then, the guild will have changed quite a bit. Yi Jeong-ryong has already revealed his hidden sword, and we'll have to face the consequences."

With the rewards they'll receive, the Peace Guild will experience remarkable growth. They should lead the way.

Someone will have to manage the guild, while others will carefully select talented and trustworthy individuals to join as loyal members of the Peace Guild.

And they will be granted martial arts skills.

"We need swords too."

As soon as I had that thought, Team Leader Choe, who completed the Intermediate Breakthrough, opened his eyes and took a deep breath. The gleam in his eyes swiftly passed me by.

One by one, the others began to open their eyes.

Ding.

Thanks to your excellent guidance, some individuals have reached the first stage of True Qi Cultivation.
You have acquired the title: Trainee Instructor!
Get ready for martial arts adventure!

It seemed like the heavens had given an order to keep going until we drop. I chuckled as I looked at the people lost in their training's afterglow.

A week had passed in the blink of an eye.

During that time, Yi Jeong-ryong and the Peace Guild secretly concluded their suspicions, two additional incidents of gate mutations occurred, and an attention-grabbing post appeared on the Hunter community website.

[Peace Guild Final Selection Review]

I used to work in the guild's security team (Rank Hunter).

Originally, I belonged to a large guild, but due to some snitch (a traitor), I was under so much stress that a few days ago, I knocked him out and started looking for job postings. That's when I came across the Peace Guild recruitment notice. So, I quickly applied.

After that, when they didn't contact me, I thought I didn't make it.

I knew about their selection process, so I didn't have high expectations from the beginning.

But now, after two weeks, they finally contacted me, saying I should start working tomorrow!

Anyone else starting tomorrow, raise your hand!

(805 comments) You just submitted your application to the Peace Guild, and you already got accepted? LOL, this jobless loser must have written a web novel or something.

ㄴ27?: Dude, why is this guy laughing?

ㄴ???: Well, maybe he's dreaming of joining the Peace Guild.

ㄴ"That ending..."

ㄴThe author should have written the novel more convincingly if he wanted to be a web novel writer. Even someone from a top-tier guild like the Security Team (Rank) got accepted after submitting their application? LOL, this is hilarious.

ㄴIs it really that easy?

ㄴHonestly, I applied this time, and the competition ratio was 47:1. They even evaluated our personality and aptitude before the interview.
ㄴWow, what's with the personality and aptitude evaluation? Are we in high school?

ㄴThis is evidence that the Peace Guild considers hunters as valuable assets.

ㄴOn the other hand, the basic salary and incentives are significantly higher than other places.

ㄴPlease consider me as a valuable asset too.

ㄴLooks like the Peace Guild has a strong financial backing. If they can recruit someone from a top-tier guild, it says a lot.

ㄴYeah, I heard they have the exclusive rights to over 20 gates.
 
ㄴ(I'm the author of the post) I just called the HR department, and they said Jin Tae-kyung insisted on hiring me, so they did?

ㄴLOL, how the hell does a loser like you know Jin Tae-kyung? Stop writing novels and get some sleep.

ㄴGoodbye, web novel author~
ㄴBy the way, any recommendations for web novels these days?

ㄴTry "Login Martial Arts." Once you get past the initial modern setting, it's quite enjoyable.

ㄴCan't wait for "Zero Big" to come out.

ㄴThat author hasn't gone on hiatus for 10 years, even though they've been serializing.

If it were any other time, it would have been a trivial conversation of idle curiosity.

However, this post confidently took the top spot in the weekly best ranking with numerous recommendations and pilgrimage-like comments.

It was because of another post that was uploaded the next evening.

[Guys, I encountered that web novel villain yesterday]

I'm one of the guys who got accepted into the Peace Guild this time. Today, while touring the guild house with my fellow new recruits, guess who we ran into?

It was none other than that scumbag from the novel, strutting around with a pompous air. We were just watching him from a distance, in awe of his presence, when suddenly he turned around and grabbed one of us, asking if he used to be from the guild's security team. When the guy confirmed it with a cool demeanor, that lunatic burst into laughter and said, "Ira-shaimase." Then he gave us an "OK" sign with his fingers. He's even more insane than I imagined.

[Attached photo]

I'm posting this to provide evidence, so you'll believe me.

(865 comments) I'm the person who had the top comment last time. Apologies and greetings, here's a big bow.

ㄴLooking at the photo proof, it seems like this is actually true.??

ㄴNo way... Why would a Rank Hunter from the security team join the Peace Guild?

ㄴSo it's real...

ㄴ(The author) In the web novel, the villain was placed in the security team instead of the raid team.

ㄴOh, well, I guess they can put whatever they want. It's not like they parachuted in; it's just a job transfer.

ㄴThey say Korea is a country of blood ties and connections. People are beyond anyone's expectations, but I'm slightly disappointed in that lunatic.

ㄴWho are you to be disappointed?

ㄴThe reason these bastards keep criticizing that lunatic is that while he walks around with a worn-out slipper, he donated almost his entire fortune to establish a foundation for gate victims.

ㄴThe comment above is a fact. Those who criticize that lunatic should be beaten until they come to their senses.

ㄴPeople keep getting weirder, just like Dooly.

ㄴBy the way, where is the author? Can you explain it more?

ㄴ(The author) I'm on my way to a company dinner right now.

ㄴA welcome party for new recruits?

ㄴ(The author) Yeah, I'm already in the car for an hour. Seems like it's quite far.

ㄴNice. Is that lunatic going with you too?

ㄴ(The author) Yeah. But I don't see the guild master and the other team leaders.
The Peace Guild seems to have a good unity. Maybe because we're still new?

ㄴ(I don't really know about that... But the atmosphere seems a bit off.
I asked a senior who joined before me, and he said he slept well during the trip.

ㄴWhy?

ㄴI guess they're planning to make the dinner last long. Who would enjoy drinking with people they're not close to?

ㄴ(The author) Is that so? Oh, looks like we've arrived.

ㄴDrink moderately. Don't forget to bring back what you'll get later.

ㄴHave a good time!

ㄴ(The author) It seems like a great restaurant. Looking forward to what we'll have for dinner, hehe. I'll be back soon.
And that was the author's last comment.

"We'll have dinner at the Gate."

Voices murmuring in response to my declaration could be heard everywhere.

"Huh?

Wait a minute. I'm sorry, but did I hear you correctly just now?"

"Dinner at the Gate, right? I must have misheard."

"Oh, yes."

Even without looking at their faces, I could tell. Those who engaged in innocent conversations were the new recruits who just started working today.

On the other hand, those who joined just two or three weeks ago were different.

"I knew it."

"Damn..."

"Good thing I brought extra potions."

"Hey, senior. Do you happen to have any arrows left?"

"Hmm. Just in case, I brought an additional 200. So take only a hundred."

Although the difference in the duration of their employment was only a month, their reactions were like night and day.

With a collective sigh, they quickly pulled out armor and equipment from their backpacks, which were quietly hiding curses.

Unorthodox!

Is this what the teacher had in mind?

I couldn't help but let out a slight smile at the unintentionally humorous situation. The new recruits still seemed confused and unsure of what was happening.

"Did everyone remember to bring all your things?"

The newcomers nodded their heads.

"Oh, yes. You told us to bring everything, so we did."

"Put your bags down and get your equipment ready."

"Huh? Are we going to have a mock battle or something?"

"Forget about the mock battle. That won't help you improve much. Real combat is where it's at!"

Some of the innocent recruits looked suspicious.

"Wait, are we really going to the Gate?"

"Yes, it's a special raid to celebrate joining the Peace Guild! Isn't that exciting?"

"But what do the others think about it? Do they like the idea?"

Suddenly, some of the more experienced guild members who had gone through tough training in the past few weeks spoke up.

"That's a fantastic idea!"

"Exactly! That's our King Taekyeong!"

"Wow, that sounds great!"

Well, it seems like they've learned from their past experiences. They remember the strong arguments made by those who opposed my opinion.

"Right, we should all face the challenges together!"

While the new recruits seemed a bit hesitant, the more experienced members expressed their enthusiasm.

"But wait, we weren't told about this before! The notice said we would only have a simple workshop for a week!"

"Listen, what we're about to do is the workshop."

"A workshop at the Gate? That's unusual! And for a whole week?"

"Yes, it's the Peace Guild's way of bonding. We'll hunt monsters together and strengthen our unity!"

"We don't want to be left out!"

The last statement was desperate, almost pleading. Hearing their concerns, I realized that I needed to approach this differently.

"It's okay, it's not as strange as it seems! In fact, it's going to be a fun and productive workshop!"

"We'll have a great time and grow stronger together!"

Let's make it a friendly and positive experience.

- Title: The effect of [Training Instructor] is activated!
- The trainees listen to your shout and become tense!

"Wow, yeol!" (Yeol is an exclamation expressing excitement.)

"Wow, yeo-eoreol!" (Eoreol is an exaggerated expression of excitement.)

"Your voices are too soft. Wow, yeol!"

"Wow, yeo-eoreol!"

They all cheer loudly but with bewildered expressions.

I turn towards their surprised faces and give them a big smile.

"Now, follow me in order. Left, right, left!"

The human train moves towards the gate.
