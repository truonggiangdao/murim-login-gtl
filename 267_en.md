I just blinked my eyes at the sudden burst of black light.

It was just like that... Where the hell did that bastard go?
In the overwhelming shock that made the pain fade away, I stood there dumbfounded, mouth agape.

He disappeared. As if erased by an eraser.
Only the blood splattered around and the wrist of Jong Li Chu, still holding onto the neck of the unconscious Cheongpung, remained as the sole evidence that he had existed.

Ding.

- Quest [Desperate Struggle] successfully completed!

- Earned a tremendous amount of experience points!

- Level up!

- Level up!

With the system notifications, my body rapidly recovered.

Broken bones fused solidly, wounds closed up, and the throbbing pain in my temples subsided. The empty energy in my body was replenished, and vitality surged through my muscles.

But there was one thing that didn't disappear, and that was the sense of bewilderment.

"Huh, what a fucking bastard."

Hyeolju. I should have killed that son of a bitch by any means necessary.

As I stared at the ground, feeling empty and murmuring to myself, a familiar voice spoke, and a hand suddenly reached out in front of me.

"Are you okay?"

Although I was mentally exhausted, my body felt fine. I grabbed Jong Li Chu's hand and stood up.

"Uh, I'm okay. Thanks to you, I survived."

That's a relief. Then let's first help the wounded... Wait, what did you just say?

Jong Li Chu blinked.

What did he hear just now? It's written all over his face.

"What?"

"@. Yeah?"

"Is there a problem?"

Jong Li Chu, who was staring at me with a momentarily blank expression, extended his hand.

"Oh, no. There's no problem. But earlier... Did you not hear it?"

"That? What was it? I briefly lost consciousness."

There's only so much you can take physically. Getting hit, standing up, falling down again, repeating it dozens of times.

And then, at some point, I took a direct hit to the jaw and briefly lost consciousness.

"When I opened my eyes, it was almost over. I saw that bastard holding onto my ankle, so I grabbed him."

"Noya."

Yellow Army.

Jong Li Chu, who seemed like he was about to say something, tightly shut his mouth.

I also wanted to know how things unfolded, who Jong Li Chu really was, but I held my tongue.

"The fact that he's an ally is what's important."

That's enough for now. There are more urgent matters all around.

"Nyoae."

Cheongpung's injuries are a concern despite the damage to the Yellow Wind.

I rushed over and examined his condition, feeling a faint pulse and the warmth of his breath.

"Can you move aside for a moment?"

Jong Li Chu, who had finished administering first aid to Cheongpung, placed his hand on the prestigious bloodline mark on Cheongpung's forehead.

As the energy flowed in, I felt his complexion becoming visibly more relaxed.

"How is it?"

"It's not a serious injury. He won't regain consciousness for a while since he spent too much energy at once, but..."

"It's the same for me. I have injuries, but I'm young, so I'll recover quickly."

"Hoo... That's unfortunate, but fortunate."

As I let out a sigh of relief, Jong Li Chu smiled.

Shh, shh, shh, shh!

The countless signs of danger approaching rapidly from below. The momentum is incredibly ominous.

"No way, again?"

With a determined expression on my face, I was about to confront the enemy when Jongrichu reached out his hand.

"Let go. They're allies," he said.

His words were true. Among the hundreds of warriors who had revealed themselves, some familiar faces from the Gufilebang and Odasega were present. They were the ones who had guarded the VIP seats during the Sungra Daeyon.

However, key figures such as Beogyeokdowang, including the core members, were nowhere to be seen.

Suddenly, a sharp-eyed man, Chonmyeon Hori, approached us. The sunlight reflected off his steel prosthetic as it sliced through the gaps in the leaves, sparkling brightly.

Chonmyeon Hori was known as a skilled warrior.

"Halt," he commanded, and the hundreds of warriors stopped in their tracks.

I was about to step forward when Jongrichu suddenly spoke up.

"Chonmyeon Hori Songho."

I couldn't believe what Jongrichu just did. He used a disrespectful tone from the beginning, which could only lead to misunderstandings and violence.

I urgently jabbed his side to stop him, but it was too late. Jongrichu blurted out a bomb-like statement.

"Are you okay, Narin?"

This was getting out of hand. Is he insane or something?

I found myself staring at Jongrichu in disbelief. He had crossed the line this time, not only with his disrespectful tone but also by insulting the disabled.

I quickly stepped forward before Chonmyeon Hori could draw his sword and confronted him.

"I apologize. He's not normally like this. Let me explain. He just needs to apologize. You bastard."

Before the situation escalated, I grabbed Jongrichu by the back of his neck and forcefully lowered his head.

When he raised his head, Chonmyeon Hori's face was as rigid as if he had seen a ghost.

"He's really angry."

Well, if he wasn't angry in this situation, then he wouldn't be human. He must be Jesus or Buddha.

However, before the tension could escalate further, it came to a sudden halt with Chonmyeon Hori's unexpected response.

"It's been a while. I beg your forgiveness."

Jongrichu chuckled like an old man and nodded his head.

"It's good to see you doing well. I knew you would be the first to recognize me."

"For a long time, I struggled. Until a few hours ago, I believed that Hyeol Gwigum (Mabet0), that damn blood demon swordsman, was behind the Banro Hwandong Movement."

"Oh, I see. So, you were also involved."

"I could only survive this far thanks to Dae Hyeop. If he hadn't rescued me back then, I wouldn't be here now."

Chuckling while tapping his sword, Cheonmyeon Hori spoke up, "I discovered the Amjungsal (950) before the curfew. It seemed like you were playing a prank."

"Oh, that guy. Now that I think about it, it's about time he woke up."

"That damned bastard who should have died is still alive. Only then did I realize I was relieved."

"I didn't want to be caught. I just wanted to hide until the end of the Sungla Dae-yeon."

Jong Li-chu added with a bitter face, "I never expected such a thing to happen."

"I feel the same way. Despite all the precautions, it happened in Sollim of all places..."

"Seeing that you've appeared, it seems that Sollim's situation has been resolved. Did the Pyeongryeok Do-wang leave?"

"Yes, as soon as he understood the situation, he divided the personnel and moved in two different directions. By now, I believe Peng Daehyup is in the process of resolving Sollim."

"The damage is too great. This shouldn't have happened."

"I have a lot to tell you about that."

"Me too."

A heavy silence lingered for a moment.

Just as I was barely able to open my mouth, Jong Li-chu, or rather 'he,' blinked.

"Did you want to say something?"

"Yes. Well, I have something to offer..."

"Ask me anything."

Hundreds of pairs of eyes turned towards my face. Their expressions seemed to say, "Finally, that crazy guy has regained his senses."

"Um, by any chance, are you..."

A confident response came back.

"I am Mae Jong-hak."

"Ah, I see. Mae Jong-hak."

The hairs on my body stood on end.

From the first encounter until now, the conversations with him and my actions flashed before my eyes like a vivid dream.

"Coincidence, it seems. You share the same name as someone I know."

"Is that so?"

I took a deep breath. The sound of my heartbeat thundered through me.

"It's chilly. A dagger pierces my chest. But don't worry. There are more people with the same name in the world than you think. Maybe I'm Ggom Jong-hak. I held onto the last hope and opened my mouth. "By any chance, do you have a nickname?"

"Yes, I do."

Damn, this is nerve-wracking.

In front of me, his young voice with a touch of laughter pierced through the darkness.

"Let's continue to be close. Friends."

Ah, I want to die.

In the direction their gazes were focused, there was a person staggering and dripping with blood.

A young man, gasping for breath, clad in blood-stained armor.
His entire body was covered in cuts, and blood was flowing incessantly from the severed ends of his two arms.

"Summon a healer! Bring a healer!"

"The Grandmaster has been critically injured!"

Hearing the urgent cries echoing in his ears, the young man slowly opened his mouth.
His arm, which he had not let go of until the end, fell to the ground with a thud. In his hand, which had detached from his body, was a short staff.

At that moment, emitting a faint green light even in the darkness, someone let out a small gasp.

"The Green Jade Fire Staff...!"

None other than the legendary artifact of the Thousand-Year Solim.

The mission that no one could guarantee success. However, even though he had become a pitiful sight, his subordinates had successfully fulfilled their duty.

Truly, as befitting the disciple cherished by 'that person.'

"I pay my respects!"

Kim Ha?

In the eyes of the young man, who had taken up a deep encirclement position, a crimson light surged.

Shhriiik!

The subordinates, with their rib cages shattered, were impaled on the wall, spraying fountains of blood.

With a chilling voice flowing from the young man's mouth, one of the subordinates was lifted up by the corpses and disappeared.

This was not an uncommon occurrence. No one mourned or wavered at the death of the rookie who foolishly stepped forward, but only felt the fear of their superior.

"Young Master, let's focus on treating your injuries first..."

"I feel dizzy. Begin."

The young man entrusted his body to the arriving healers.

Though he desperately wanted to slaughter everything that came into his sight, he barely restrained himself.

He needed to conserve his strength for now. He had to recover as soon as possible to kill those bastards.

Gomsung, Hwawang, Cheongpung, and... Sanseo Jamryong, Jin Tae-kyung.

When he thought of the face of that scum covered in blood-soaked fangs, his blood boiled in reverse.

He swung his fist, unable to overcome his anger, and struck the head of the healer.

The body of the man, who lost his mind, collapsed like a rotten tree. Feeling the frightened gazes of the healers, the young man muttered to himself in a low voice.

"I can't afford to kill more valuable healers. Keep going."

For a moment, the treatment stopped. It was an inexplicable and eerie sight. Broken bones fused back together, and flesh regenerated.

In the midst of the pain accompanying his recovery, the young man gritted his teeth. As his vision faded to white, the face of one person came to mind.

"That... I'll kill her with my own hands. Without fail."
