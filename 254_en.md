"Jin Tae-kyung, the Dragon of Xanji, emerges as the winner!"

The judges' enthusiastic shout prompted a wave of excitement as tens of thousands of spectators stood up together.

The man's eyes were fixated on Jin Tae-kyung, who gracefully descended from the stage amidst the cheers and applause.

"Such an incredible display," he thought to himself, marveling at the strength and skill required to master the unique Batting Stick method.

Despite its peculiar name, this technique is considered one of the top ten in the world, renowned for its impressive power and mystical qualities.

To everyone's surprise, Jin Tae-kyung effortlessly shattered the batting stick without relying on any special martial arts moves.

Using only his bare fists, he shattered the bamboo jang with astonishing force, not even flinching when struck by the formidable Dragon Heart blows.

The man couldn't help but wonder, "Was he purposely seeking to challenge himself instead of avoiding those strikes?"

"It seems my initial impression was wrong. He doesn't enjoy pain but rather exudes confidence and self-assurance," he contemplated.

Curiosity piqued, the man pondered how Jin Tae-kyung achieved such an extraordinary feat, defying expectations.

"Regardless, he's an incredibly fascinating individual. I'll never forget the awe I felt when I first witnessed his remarkable abilities."

Jin Tae-kyung's physique seemed almost ethereal, as if he descended from the heavens with remarkable grace and power.

"If there were a celestial being, he might embody its essence," the man imagined.

As a disciple of the King of Fire, he felt compelled to observe Jin Tae-kyung closely and learn from his unique approach.

With these thoughts in mind, the man turned around and mingled with the enthusiastic crowd, casting glances at the retreating figure of Rising Sword Jong Lichu.

Around him, ordinary faces abounded—a friendly merchant with a round belly, an elderly man with a stooped back, a martial artist of moderate skill, and a humble soldier clad in simple military attire.

Yet, as their conversations unfolded, whispers of their extraordinary martial arts skills floated in the air, reminding the man that these were no ordinary individuals, but masters of their craft.

And a middle-aged beggar who was sitting on the street begging, got up after bending over at the small money people threw at him for a while.

The change occurred in an alley with few people.

Pudeudeudeuk, Steuk.

The stooped shoulders spread out, and the twisted spine stood straight. Then, as if an invisible hand was kneading, the muscles in her face trembled.

Before taking ten steps, the middle-aged beggar had changed into a warm-hearted old man.

again. again.

A prosthetic leg made of ebony wood (40, which is said to be as hard as steel) knocked on the stone floor.

'Rising sword bell weight:'

The old man, Cheonmyeonhori Songho, remembered his name in his mind.

Before being a footnote to Eunyeonggak, he is also a source of information and a master of reverse magic.
He never forgot his face once he had seen it, and recognized his opponent by the slightest habit or skeleton. Even if he used reverse magic, he couldn't escape his eyes.

However, one person, Jonglichu, was an exception.

'Surely he and I have met:
When and where was it?

Song-ho, who was deep in thought as he recalled Jong-ri-chu's face, stopped walking due to the pain in his legs.

'It's starting again. It's getting more intense these days. It was a really old wound.

Decades ago, as a young man, he participated in the final battle against the Demonic Cult and lost a leg.

He barely survived after many twists and turns, but his memories of that day were deeply engraved in his brain like a painting.

Even the voice of one person, long and dark like the abyss.

'Cheonmyeonhori Songho. It's quite a feat for a fox. Shall we start with the legs of the store first?"

Song-ho, who was trembling, endured the pain and moved on again.

It is a past where not even remnants remain. Rather, the reality had to be focused on the present.

'Good luck... Who are you? What else are you up to?"

All preparations have already been completed. Even so, the uneasiness that remained in his chest kept shaking him.

“Have I become foolish? Has peace been long? A low sigh leaked from the old man's lips.

He closed his eyes.

He recalled a person from the pitch darkness. A youthful face with a bright smile and a normal body.

But when he drew his sword, everything changed.

Shhh!

You can see it even if you don't see it. Even if you can't hear it, you can hear it.

A self-weighted sword that was unleashed without any gaps in thirty-six directions.

It was as bright as a beam of light and as gentle as a flower petal. Looking at that beautiful sight, I thought.

'The priesthood of annihilation, the extension of flames, or... …

In addition, a few martial arts come to mind and then disappear.

Cheongpung is an opponent who requires my best effort.
In the end, the fence is one. At the end of a brief thought, I gripped the slender spearstick, and it was that moment.
Creak.
"Captain. Captain."

My thoughts were shattered by the sound of a piercing voice. The image of Cheongpungdo and the imaginary sword I had conjured vanished into thin air.

When I raised my eyelids, I saw Hyuk Moo-jin poking his head through the crack in the door.

"Hey. I'm here."

I stared at him blankly and opened my mouth.

"Why are you here?"

"I came to talk to you because I was worried you might be hostile."

"A comrade?"

"Yes. Isn't that great?"

"Excellent?"

I let out a deep sigh and pulled out the chair leg.

"Give it here, you rascal."

"Why? Why are you doing this?"

"Did Cheongpungdo put you up to this? Interfering with my training?"

"Captain, were you actually training?"

"Well, do any of you meditate in the lotus position?"

Hyuk Moo-jin, who was observing me, replied with a sip of his drink.

"Captain, I heard that when you were younger, you used to sit on a chair and attempt to train in magic."

"That wasn't me... But are you actually talking to me now?"

"No, can't you even reply?"

No, this kid is crazy.

I stared at Hyuk Moo-jin with wide eyes. In the past, I would have aimed for his head first, but I hesitated for a moment and then covered my chest.

"What are you up to now?"

"By the way, I believe I've been contributing in my own way by assisting the captain."

"So?"

"Please treat me accordingly."

"What kind of treatment? Are you talking about some kind of insurance? If I get injured in the future, will you treat it as an industrial accident?"

"I have no idea how to deal with private insurance or industrial accidents. If you keep going like this, I might just give up everything and take over the linen shop."

After pondering for a moment, I nodded my head.

"Alright then."

"Good job. No, excellent work, Mr. Mujin. May the fabric store thrive in the future."

"Wait, hold on."

"Oh right. I don't know about other places, but be prepared to close down the main store in Shanxi."

Thunk!

Hyuk Moo-jin, hugging his calf, spoke with a desperate look.

"I made a mistake."

"Yes, please hit me on the back of my head."

"Do you want me to treat you nicely?"

"No, I have become someone who can't survive a day without the captain's knife."

"Are you out of your mind?"

I shook my head and lightly tapped the boy's forehead.

"Stop talking nonsense and get to the point. Why did you come?"

"That's right, I actually came here to cause a commotion."

As I opened my eyes, Hyuk Moo-jin's voice became more serious.

"Tomorrow is the final, so I thought the pressure would be immense..."

"The opponent hasn't been decided yet, so what's the point? Don't you know today is the last day of the semi-finals?"

As the sun slowly began to set, the dance between Jonglichu and Cheongpung would soon commence.

At my words, Hyuk Moo-jin shrugged.

"I know, but I dropped by."

"He's such a cool guy. Practicing at a time like this, man."

Even though I say that, a part of my heart felt heavy. When I think about it, Mujin has gone through a lot of hardships following me.

Perhaps the reason I sometimes speak nonsense is because I've destroyed so many brain cells with my head smashes.

"I apologize for thinking of you like that."

When he made a promise to do well in the future, Hyuk Moo-jin asked.

"Cheongpung Soheung will win, right?"

"That's correct... Wait, how do you know that?"

"The person I carried may not know, but I should know. His name is Kang Poong, with the childish nickname of the Invincible Divine Sword. He even used Ja Ha-gong in the last fight, so how can you not know?"

"Are you smarter than I thought?"

"Rumors have been spreading. Although Cheongpung Soheung is not well-known, most people know him as a disciple of the Volcano Sect."

Well, Jaha-gong is distinctive enough to be deduced.

"So, are you sure that Cheongpung Soheung will win?"

"Isn't it obvious?"

"You better be sure. Absolutely!"

What? Those eyes filled with greed, yet still unaware. It was a moment where I nodded in awe.

"Wow!"

A shout that echoed from not far away.

I picked up the spear, the white flame, that I had placed in the sheath and stood up.

"No matter what, it's a clash of blue winds. That fact doesn't change.

It's an obvious battle between the egg and the rock.

But observing how the egg breaks and how the rock shatters the egg will be of great help in the final match."

"What are you doing? That won't happen."

"We have the lifelong sword!"

"I bet on you, hermit! Show them what you've got!"

"Hahaha! Not an invincible new sword, but a lifelong sword? There are no black cows."

Jonglichu, who was on stage amidst the blazing torches and the thunderous laughter, suddenly stopped.

It was because of the eyes that looked down on him from the seat of honor.

There were at least three masters known as the Ten Kings (TT+Po). I could see the leaders of the Gupai Bang and the Five Generations, as well as Songho from Cheonmyeonhori, who quietly exchanged glances at the very back.

"Rising sword bell weight. Take your designated position."

The pause after the footsteps stopped was extremely short. At the judge's words, Jonglichu, stepping onto the stage, drew his sword without hesitation.

Swish!

The sudden action erupted into laughter from the previously quiet surroundings.

As for the sword swing, the pattern was unrecognizable because the grooves were filled with debris, and the sword blade was covered in red rust.

For a warrior, their weapon is cherished as if it were their own life, but it seemed that Jonglichu's sword had never been cared for since its creation.

"What is that?"
"Once again, something surprising."

"That's why it's a lifelong sword. What did you expect?"

Jonglichu held back his words as he carefully examined the rusted sword blade amidst the laughter of the people.

"I can't use the Nangjang sword."

At that moment, Cheongpung, who was enthusiastically greeting the crowd, offered his sword.

"Uh, would you like to borrow mine? Or, will you use mine?"

"No, you should keep it."
"I'll be fine..."

"Are you sure? And what about you?"

"It doesn't matter. We're friends."

When Qing Feng nodded earnestly, Jonglichu smiled kindly.

"Just take heart. Mine is enough."

"Because we're still friends..."

"Look."

Sigh.

The red, rusty blade of the sword pointed towards the blue wind.

In the mischievous eyes of Jonglichu, a spark was flickering.
"I've never had a friend like you."
