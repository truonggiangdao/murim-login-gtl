Gugugu Palace.

In the distance, along with the sound of Asrai, the ground trembled slightly.

While commoners who were unaware of martial arts raised their heads and continued on their way, Cheonmyeon Hori Songho was different.

"This is..."
The Eunyeonggak agents who were secretly following behind Songho let out a signal.
- Call off the Northern expedition
- The taste between Moonil and Seonggan
- Main shareholder 8
Songho was conflicted. Based on his previous experiences, he suspected that this sound was a repercussion of martial arts.

And not just any repercussion... a supreme master?

A presence that could turn the world upside down and might surpass thirty people, the supreme masters.
The repercussions he felt undoubtedly meant clashes between the supreme masters.

It was not an ordinary event. Finally, what had that bastard Sangseong Sword Jeongli-chu done?

"However, we should be well-prepared for it."

The Wulin League had thoroughly searched its surroundings. They conducted meticulous inspections and searches, considering the possibility of smuggling and installing explosives (ppu8).

Even though his power may not be as strong as before, the Eunyeonggak's information-gathering abilities were sufficient to control Hanam City.

"And there are three Shimwang (+gu)?"

In addition to that, there were the leaders of the Gupailbang and Odaese-ga, as well as the elite members of the Eunmoon Faction. It was not an exaggeration to say that a condensed version of the Wulin world was present there.

"I was worried for nothing. It was all because of the unknown entities that have yet to reveal themselves."

Songho vividly remembered the conversation he had with the Lawking Gyeongdo a year ago.
"The dark clouds are covering the sky."
"Could it be the dark clouds coming from Cheonsan?"
"We don't know where they come from or when they'll arrive. All we have are the two characters, 'Amcheon' (Dark Stream)."
"Amcheon... it's going to help us. We need your strength."

Since the Great War, thirty years had passed. The fox, who had lived secluded from the world, had once again emerged, realizing the passage of time.

Yal let out a sigh, and Cheonmyeon Hori Songho clenched his lips.

Giggle

Black shadows flowed through the alleyways.

In the midst of the endless row of roofs, as Songho rushed out, the reports from his subordinates, who had been monitoring behind him, played in his mind.

"We found the Amjungsar (Hidden Assassin)."

Tap!

Strength surged through the crutch that displayed martial arts prowess

SIA,

Kagagak!

The warrior turned, spinning his spear as he changed direction. The tighter he gripped the spear, the more he felt himself falling behind.

Jongrichu's black horse and my chariot followed the direction of the horse.

With a transparent blade made of perennial steel, the spear pierced the ground, and Jongrichu's palm was struck.

Boom!

The compressed air in front of his chest burst out, and his vision faded.

I barely supported the staggering body trying to retreat. Clutching the deeply embedded spear, I circled around and reached the enemy's front.

A blue flame emerged on my right foot, filled with explosive power.

"Hwaryungak (《\0)."

The blazing flames struck Jongrichu's neck.

Crack!

The staggering enemy lowered his elbow. The sleeves that were perfectly hit turned to dust and fluttered.

"Too bad. I liked that smile of yours."

Thud.

The enemy, like a third-rate thug, smirked, shaking his head from side to side.

"But truly, you're impressive. You're getting better and better. Well, then..."

Huff!

With a sharp gust of wind, he disappeared. A voice whispered right next to me.

"Let's start properly."

Boom. The wind was fierce. This time, my senses were faster than my body. In an instant, his fist struck my raised arms.

An attack imbued with tremendous power.

Flash!

It already surpassed the ordinary limits. Even though it was a clash of energies, the explosion resounded like a bomb detonating.

At the last moment, I used Cheongeunchu's technique to support my body, but my waist felt as if it was being crushed against the ground.

Thud.

Even the extraordinary muscular strength was useless. I endured the tingling pain flowing through my spine.

"How dare he..."

Bam!

I struck the ground with my empty left hand. When I stood up, I saw Jongrichu's face brightly smiling beyond the hazy cloud of dust that had been charred by the battle.

"I made a bad choice. As you can see, you're confident in your power."

I glared at Jongrichu, who was calmly smiling, and spat out blood. The color of the blood was dark, evidence of internal injuries.

"Damn it."

The opponent was a master who had reached the pinnacle of combat skills. I expected it to some extent, but he was stronger than I thought.

"No matter how much martial arts I've learned, how can someone at that age possess such power?"

"You, what the hell are you really?"

As I wiped the blood with my sleeve, Jongrichu chuckled.

"That's actually the question I want to ask. I never thought I'd encounter a monster like you in my lifetime."

"This bastard even dares to deceive."

"It's the truth."

"The truth is a plague. If I'm a monster, what about you?"

"I... I'm a little special in this world."

I looked at Jongrichu, who was smiling subtly, and a surge of pain spread through my body. Perhaps due to the injury.

"Is this also a legendary martial art or something?"

"When people encounter something beyond their understanding, they often think of magic (※39). It's not easy to accept it as it is."

"Well, it's really not easy. So what kind of martial arts did you learn?"

"Any more questions would be a waste of time."

He raised the added sword and aimed it at me. Transparent energy flowed from him like a stream, taking on a solid form.

Jongli Choo (Unseen Energy). A collection of energy allowed for those who step into the realm of ultimate perfection.

Tsutsutsutsu!
Just by looking at it, a chilling sensation runs through my spine. The force emanating from Jongli Choo made my palms damp and my lips tremble.

"This... is dangerous."

I took a deep breath. I can't even remember how many times I've been on the verge of death before, and now those memories are fading away.

What's important is that I've survived every time, and I will continue to do so in the future.

That's why I followed Hwawang, enduring rigorous training that seemed impossible to overcome.

"Sleep only lasts for an hour. The remaining time is strictly for training!"

Damn inspiring words.

Suddenly, before delving into intense training, I recalled what Jeokcheon-gang had said and chuckled.

"Sounds like a one-hour ordeal. The time granted to me was only half an hour. Without the rapid recovery system for the body, it would have been unbearable days."

Despite the reduced sleep time, my iron will only grew stronger. Even in such adverse conditions, I threw punches, kicked, and wielded a spear.

"That was a godly move."

Shimba.
"Our master was right. Sleep is a luxury for the weak. And..."

I opened the status window.

In my mind, a holographic window filled my vision. The levels and the number of titles written in the status window have changed significantly in the past year.

However, there was only one thing that mattered to me now.
- Remaining Points: 500

"Repeat quests are amazing."

The endless repetition of training means repetitive quests.

And the points gained from leveling up. It's amazing to see how the savings I diligently accumulated over a year have turned into a substantial amount.

"That's why people should save."

"What does that mean?"

Without understanding the meaning behind his words, I smirked at Jongli Choo and raised Baekyeom.

"Things are going to get tougher from now on."

At the same time, numerous system commands resounded in my mind.

Strength, agility, stamina. Muscles and tendons. 

Everything advances as new power gathers, intertwines, and permeates.

In this endlessly slowing world, I take a step forward.

Swook.
There was no sound. I stood before Jongli Choo after taking a step.

Hwaryong Divine Spear (%08000) at the 7th stage danced through the air and sound, its tip ablaze with light, towards Jongli Choo's entire body. 

Pa-pa-pa-pa-pot!

The tip of the spear poured out rays of light, while at the same time, the transparent added sword of the guy surrounded by Unseen Energy moved.

Gwa-aah!

In an instant, dozens of exchanges occurred within a split second. Through my astonishment, I caught a glimpse of Jongli Choo's eyes.

The loud noise continuously erupted and overlapped. I wondered if such a sound would occur if the sky were to collapse.

Swish, swish, swish!

When the spear and sword separated, a crater appeared with a single blow, engulfing the surroundings in dust. Golden grooves resembling spiderwebs formed on the indestructible surface.

But more than anything, it was Jongli Choo who was astonishing.

"Amazing! Truly amazing!"

His eyes, filled with delight, shone as he continued his attack.

Despite giving his all, his movements became faster and stronger.

"What kind of person is this...!"

My heart wavered, causing my limbs to tremble. The disturbed calmness led to a mistake.

Fwubberbug!

"Move!"

Before my eyes, everything turned white, and a strong force rushed in.

As I staggered backward, Jongli Choo looked at me with an amazed expression.

"Sanseojamryong Jin Taegyeong. Remember it well. You are the one..."

At that moment, Jongli Choo's expression hardened abruptly.

As if being drawn by something, he suddenly slammed his face into the ground.

Bang!

In an instant, something happened.

Staring blankly at his disappearing figure, I regained my senses and shouted in frustration.

"Where are you going? You bastard!"
