"Now we can start."

The signal from the Seoul Central Association Chairman came after about 10 minutes of the Peace Guild, led by Choi Min-woo, initiating their protest.

The gate was a fierce battlefield where life and death were decided in an instant. In such a place, no one expected Jin Tae-kyung, left alone to face the Named Monster leading hundreds of Skeleton units, to survive.

"Did he make it?"

"It's been exactly one hour and eight minutes. If there's even a trace of his body, it would be fortunate~"

"Damn it. This was supposed to be a rescue operation, not a body retrieval mission."

"Is this really necessary? We're in a hurry, and yet we're wasting time."

"What can we do? It's not just an ordinary S-class gate; a Named Monster has appeared. If you think about it, the Association's position is understandable. It would be a disaster if they rushed in and a major accident occurred."

Hunters preparing to enter and journalists capturing every situation started to chatter.

Some were angry about the delayed rescue operation, while others defended the Association's decision.

However, no one had any concern about Jin Tae-kyung's survival. It was an obvious fact, so there was no need to mention it.

"By the way, the Peace Guild has had quite a show, haven't they?"

"That's right. Jin Tae-kyung is already, well, unfortunate. But openly insulting the Seoul Association Chairman in front of the cameras? That's a storm of trouble."

"I'm telling you. That human was already a parachute, and now he's causing trouble for the media."

As Choi Min-woo listened to the conversations around him, his face stiffened.

The disadvantages that the Peace Guild would face in the future?

He didn't care about such things.

"What does it matter who dies? I want to rush out right now. I want to take down those annoying people who are making noise and blocking the way."

But until now, he had been waiting for about ten minutes because of a few words that Kim Jipsa had objected to.

"Didn't His Highness say so? He trusts Mr. Jin Tae-kyung more than himself."

He forcibly suppressed his anger at those words.

That's right. He had always shown miracles and turned the impossible into possible. Today was just an extension of that.

He believed in that and wanted to believe in it.

"Isn't that right, Mr. Jin Tae-kyung?"

Choi Min-woo took a deep breath and stepped forward. Over fifty members of the Peace Guild followed him with determined faces.

"We, the Peace Guild, will take the lead."

The Seoul Association Chairman replied with an unfriendly gaze.

"That's the jurisdiction of the commander of this operation. But it seems like your actions are more like a notification."

"Yes."

"What should I say again? I said it was a notification."

Before the Chairman could say anything, Choi Min-woo's cold voice continued.

"I have no further intention to delay or mix words. The Peace Guild is taking the lead."

"Such arrogance...!"

At that moment, the Chairman's face turned red as if it were about to burst.

"Then go ahead and do that."

A voice without height or depth was heard from behind. The Chairman turned his head.

In his line of sight stood Seok Go-jun, the right arm of Yi Jeong-ryong and the leader of the security team, with an expressionless face, arms crossed.

"Team Leader Seok?"

"Please understand the feelings of Peace Guild members who have lost their comrades with whom they shared joys and sorrows. It would be appreciated by the media as well."

"H-However, there are Named Monsters inside the gate. If we put unproven hunters at the forefront, it could lead to a disaster."

The president was about to continue speaking but halted at the stern gaze of Seok Go-jun.

In that moment, he forgot that the other person was not just a team leader of Ares Guild but also Jeong-ryong's personal bodyguard and right-hand man.

Furthermore, he realized that what Seok Go-jun wanted was exactly what he was concerned about: the possibility of a disaster.

The president's dilemma was brief.

"Let the Peace Guild take the lead. And three minutes later, the Association and Ares Guild will..."

However, Choi Min-woo had already turned and was walking toward the gate.

Ignoring the president, Seok Go-jun, and the countless eyes on him, he paid no attention.

"Let's go. To save Jin Tae-kyung."

Choi Min-woo's determined voice echoed through the hall, causing a resounding cheer.

Kim Jibsa, Im Geok-jeong, Song Song-i, and over fifty Peace Guild members followed closely behind Choi Min-woo, parting the crowd of hunters like a torrent, heading toward the gate.

At that moment, Kim Jibsa's voice erupted from his lips.

"All members of the Peace Guild, prepare for a major assault!"

Clang!

The moving armor and weapons glistened in the sunlight. In an instant, the fifty-plus Peace Guild members transformed into a single arrow, shooting forward.

Leading the charge, with a thunderous shout, Choi Min-woo leaped toward the magic barrier.

"Engage!"

Swish!

Had the sensation of the gate's magic always felt this unsettling?

Choi Min-woo felt a flickering unease deep within his chest as he opened his eyes wide. Unbeknownst to him, his heart sank heavily.

"This is..."

To describe the scene unfolding before his eyes, was there a more appropriate word?

The path leading from the hill where the gate entrance was situated to the gate itself was entirely covered in magic &mdash; an otherworldly phenomenon.

The sense of unease he felt when passing through the gate gradually took on tangible form.

From behind him, Im Geok-jeong asked with a worried voice.

"Team Leader Choi, is Tae-kyung..."

"Stop. We're in the middle of the mission. Personal concerns are prohibited."

But this time, Choi Min-woo's words lacked conviction.

The situation in front of him seemed hopeless, and not only Im Geok-jeong but all the Peace Guild members were faltering.

"No, it can't be."

With determination, Choi Min-woo tightly clenched his lips and took a heavy step forward.

"Continue the approach. Don't let your guard down and advance."

They cautiously moved forward, prepared for the possible appearance of monsters.

Yet, the further they approached the magical path, the more the feeling of despair permeated the Peace Guild members.

"It can't be."

Broken bones and a scorched earth covered in dark dust.
In that place overflowing with death and destruction, there was no trace of life to be found. Even the person who had desperately hoped to find something was left disappointed.

"Is he really dead?"

The more familiar people were with Jin Tae-kyung, the harder it was for them to believe the unbelievable reality. They blinked their eyes in a daze.

The words of Kim Jibsa, like a doctor's final diagnosis, echoed in everyone's minds.

"After using detection magic... No movement or living beings were found within a 300-meter radius."

Min-woo's eyelids trembled.

"Does that mean..."

"I'm sorry."

With a gloomy face, Kim Jibsa raised his hand. Something floated slowly from the direction his hand pointed.

"Nan-gwon..."

"It seems to have a significant magical power, similar to traces of a named monster."

What rested on Kim Jibsa's palm was a small metal fragment, about the size of a hand.

Despite being flipped and twisted, it still retained its glossy black sheen. As the finely detailed skull pattern became visible, some people couldn't help but gasp.

"A skull pattern! Yes, it's the armor worn by a named monster!"

"That's right! We saw it clearly."

Someone who was scanning the surroundings shouted like a scream.

"Here's a dagger too! It's not the equipment used by a skeleton!"

"It belongs to Senior Jin Tae-kyung. It's a product he often used."

In the tense atmosphere, Kim Jibsa spoke with a subdued voice.

"It doesn't seem to be oxidized. It's the equipment of all enemies, including named monsters..."

The air surrounding the pathway quivered with a piercing sound.

Now everything became clear. Jin Tae-kyung was dead. He had sacrificed his own life to join the enemy on their journey to the afterlife.

The silence, which seemed endless, was finally broken by the sound of Im Geokjeong's crying.

"Sob, it can't be true!"

A slight tremor that started from his hands spread to his arms, shoulders, and back before engulfing his whole body. Tears streamed down from Im Jeong's large eyes.

"Taekyung, Taekyung... Sob!"

No one mocked him while he sobbed and trembled.

Although the size of their grief may have varied, everyone in that place shared the same sentiment.

The sorrow of Jin Tae-kyung's death, the self-blame for not being able to fight alongside him, and the feeling of helplessness towards oneself.

The members of the Peace Guild had bloodshot eyes, and tears streamed down the cheeks of Kim Jibsa and Songsong.

The only person who didn't cry was Choi Min-woo.

"He's dead. Jin Tae-kyung."

With his dark pupils, he looked around the dimly lit pathway where the acrid smoke still lingered.

It felt like he could suddenly pop out from somewhere, like a surprise box.

"I thought you would survive in any situation."

Suddenly, his chest felt tight. It was the first time something like this happened since he left his parents.

The sadness swelled up like a balloon, ready to burst at any moment.

"Well, it's a tragic sight."

"Jin Tae-kyung is nowhere to be found. It seems he's truly dead."

As Choi Min-woo slowly turned around, hundreds of people entered the pathway.

At the forefront were two people: the guildmaster and those hunters who participated in the rescue operation.

"It seems the rescue was in vain. Isn't that right, Guildmaster?"

"Yeah, that's right. They all turned into a pile of ashes. Never mind that, where are the named monsters?"

"We'll have to conduct a detailed search, but according to the detection magic results, it seems all the concerns you had, Guildmaster, have been resolved."

The guildmaster's wrinkled face widened with a smile upon hearing Seok Go-jun's words.

"Oh, that's good news. I thought we would have more casualties."

"Thanks to your judgment, we were able to minimize the sacrifices."

"Don't mention it. It's all thanks to the assistance from the Ares Guild. Once everything is settled, I will definitely present a token of gratitude. Hehe. It's my first achievement during my term, so I plan to celebrate it in a big way... I suppose Guildmaster Lee Jeong-ryong will attend as well?"

"He's not the guildmaster, but the deputy guildmaster."

"Ah, right. I've been getting forgetful lately, probably because I'm getting old."

A dry laugh formed on Seok Go-jun's lips.

"That's possible. And if a token of gratitude is presented, the deputy guildmaster will be pleased to attend with a happy heart."

"It's been a while since we last saw each other. Team Leader Seok, please say some nice words."

"Just by reporting what I've seen and heard, you'll be greatly impressed."

-Riha

The conversation between Seok Go-jun and the guildmaster was like a sharp needle that could burst Choi Min-woo's peaceful emotions like a balloon.

"Shut your mouth."

A sharp silence fell.

The guildmaster, who realized what he had just said a little too late, contorted his expression.

But Seok Go-jun was one step ahead of him.

"You better be careful with your words."

"The young friend doesn't know his manners. Don't you think so? Team Leader Choi Min-woo of the Peace Guild."

It was a piercing remark.

For Seok Go-jun, Choi Min-woo was a distant thread. The Ares Guild established by his great-grandfather was practically under Lee Jeong-ryong's control, and even Jin Tae-kyung, who was an important figure, had died. There was no need for him to hold back.

"I understand that emotions are running high due to the guild members' deaths, but it seems there is a need to calm down."

Choi Min-woo muttered as if to himself.

"If you guys hadn't wasted time, we could have survived."

"We did our best. The guildmaster's judgment was correct, and..."

Seok Go-jun spoke in a dry voice.

"You are also responsible, aren't you? Isn't that right?"

Swee-ah-hyeok,

"What were you doing when Jin Tae-kyung died? Were you calmly reading the newspaper in the office? Or were you at the tavern since noon?"

Choi Min-woo bit his lip. Every word Seok Go-jun spoke was true.

Because he trusted Jin Tae-kyung, he focused on training above all else.

But... at least he shouldn't have been like that.

Once again, a needle flew at him, unable to easily open his mouth.

"You killed Jin Tae-kyung. It was all of you who had become weak and forgotten your responsibilities who killed him."

Seok Go-jun smirked.

"It's too late to regret. The dead don't come back."

It was a moment when Choi Min-woo clenched his fist as if it was about to explode.

"What did you say, you damn bastard?"

A firm but powerful voice pierced through everyone's ears.

Those who didn't know that voice were bewildered by the sudden curse, while those familiar with it froze like statues.

"No way..."

Slowly turning his head, Choi Min-woo saw someone walking along the pathway, stumbling and staggering from afar.

"In the time it took to take a piss, you managed to finish 49 cases, you damn bastard."

Jin Tae-kyung spat out phlegm.

"Damn right. You son of a bitch."
