"What the heck are you doing?"

With a single phrase that carried many implications, Jong-ri's eyebrows arched like a crescent moon.

"Do I need to say it again?"

"Jong-ri Chu from Unnam. Yeah, I know.
So..."

The following voice that flowed out was surprisingly calm, even to myself.

"Who am I? It's you."
"Before that, how about dealing with the guy behind you?"

Jong-ri's words were true. I grabbed Cheongpung's collapsing arm.

There was a slight bleeding from the slashed chest, but it was by no means an injury that would make someone as skilled as Cheongpung fall.

"What did you do?"

"Nothing much. Just a little damage to his spirit."

"If something happens to Cheongpung..."
"You worry too much. It was just a bluff, so nothing like what you're thinking will happen."

"A bluff? That strike just now?"

"If you can't believe it, there's no point in saying more. Friendship is a good thing."

As I watched Jong-ri smiling softly, it felt like my stomach was engulfed in flames.

I was easily fooled.

I remember our first encounter.

That cheerful troublemaker who claimed that even brushing against someone's clothes meant they were destined to be friends. It was bothersome, but I didn't dislike it.

But now, I don't know anymore. Not a single thing about that guy. Everything is hidden behind a veil.

It was when I involuntarily held Byakuen (Seoâ€») in my hand.

"Wait, hold on!"

The owner of the urgent voice who interjected was an examiner. He showed signs of surprise and confusion at the unexpected turn of events.

"Both of you, step back. And Jin So-hyeop, intruding during combat violates the regulations of the Sungra Dae-yeon."

Without taking my eyes off Jong-ri, I boldly replied.

"So, you're saying we should just stand by while someone gets killed?"

"Well, that... was just a bluff, right?"

"That's just a figure of speech."

The examiner bit his lip at my resolute response.

"If you don't step back now... according to the regulations, you may face disqualification."

"Disqualification?"

"Of course. You wouldn't want to be disqualified with the final match still ahead, would you?"

I smirked.

Winning the Sungra Dae-yeon? Surely, it would bring me significant experience points, reputation, or even greater rewards.

Jinwi-kyung would proudly embrace me, elevating the prestige of my family, and Jeokcheon-gang would be satisfied.

"But that's all there is to it:
One year at Yeolhwa-dong wasn't solely for the purpose of winning the Sungra Dae-yeon.

And it would be the same for the dangerous guy standing before me now.
"Let's have a match."

Jong-ri widened his eyes slightly.

"You mean now?"

~~
"Hey, if you don't step back immediately, you'll face disqualification, you know?"

"I don't care about that."

"You're so reckless. Thanks to that, I can easily secure victory and make a name for myself throughout the world."

"You're blabbering. Put aside your acting and speak honestly."

Jong-ri chuckled deceptively.

"My judgment was accurate. You're definitely an interesting friend."

"Friend? That's not a word to use in this situation. Especially not between you and me."

"I'm a little disappointed... Well, can't help it."

"So, what's your answer?"

"I've always wanted to face you at least once."

The examiner who had been listening to our conversation interjected with a stern face.

"Have you not heard the words of this examiner?
And according to the regulations, the final match of the Sungra Dae-yeon should take place tomorrow."

At that moment, a sharp voice pierced through everyone's minds.

"Well then, let's change those regulations starting from today."

"Who dares to!"

The examiner who turned around, exploding with anger, froze in place. It was because of the small elderly man who had approached like a ghost.

"You, Jeok Dae-hyeop?"

Hwawang Jeokcheon-gang. His eyes, shining dimly, passed through me and Jong-ri, focusing on the examiner.
"Yes, it's me."

"I apologize. I misspoke."

"Doesn't matter. Get rid of him and proceed with the next combat quickly."

"But, but..."

"But?"

The examiner swallowed dry saliva.

"To change the schedule, it requires a meeting and approval from the chairman (Top-tom)."

"The first chairman of the Sungra Dae-yeon was Musin. After he disappeared, the leader of the Sollim faction, who can be considered the host, took over. Isn't that right?"

"Y-Yes."

"Then it's settled."

"Excuse me?"

"Gwangdo had urgent matters and momentarily left his seat. According to the hierarchy and distribution of the martial world, the current chairman should be No Bu-i."

All eyes turned toward the empty seat outside the hundred rows. As Jeokcheon-gang had said, the seat that Lawang Gwangdo should be occupying was vacant.

No, there was one more person who couldn't be seen.

"Cheonmyeon Hori Songho."

Both of the key figures were absent at the same time. What could be happening?

A thread of doubt arose but quickly vanished. It wasn't important right now.

"Now, we can put away those troublesome regulations. Was No Bu-i wrong?"

"That's..."

The conflicting examiner lowered his head.

"Very well, proceed."

"Understood."
"Good. And you."

Jong-ri, who had been watching this spectacle with great interest, pointed to his chest with his hand.

"Me? Are you talking about me?"

"Yeah, I'm talking about you, the stubborn one."

"Well, my tongue isn't split in half, but I got it."

He is fully aware of who his opponent is, yet he remains nonchalant.

Jeokcheon-gang stared at Jong-ri with a sinking gaze.
"Let me ask you straightforwardly. Did you come from Cheonsan?"

The Cheonsan Mountain Range (%144400). The headquarters of the Mago.

Upon hearing those words, the examiner was startled as if he had been burned, while Jong-ri revealed a faint smile, as if enjoying the situation.

"Write it down. We'll have that discussion later."

"If you don't want to be clear, you'll have to think carefully before having a discussion."

Jong-ri flicked his smooth chin.
"Before hearing that discussion, what if something unfortunate happens?"

"Unfortunate event?"

"In the martial world, you never know what might happen. For example, a master losing their one and only disciple, wouldn't that be regrettable?"

At that moment, a deathly silence pressed upon the surroundings.

Jeokcheon-gang, who had been gazing at Jong-ri with an indifferent look, opened his mouth.

"If such an unfortunate event were to occur... the master who lost their disciple would surely be enraged."
"To the point of unleashing the Cheonra Jimang (36088800)?"

"I wouldn't go that far. I would burn them alive with their body intact. I guarantee it."

"Aren't you too confident? Without even knowing who it is."

"Coincidentally, No Bu-i knows them very well."

"Oh, really."

Jong-ri burst into a cheerful laughter.

"Then I'll have to keep an eye on the situation."

"Aren't you underestimating your disciple too much?"
"I have high expectations, but my opponent probably won't be you."

"If that's the case, what do you think?"

In response to Jeokcheon-gang's question, I clenched my fist and answered confidently.

"That guy, his thinking has gone astray."

Jong-ri looked at me as if finding it amusing.

"Is what you're showing self-confidence or arrogance, I can't tell."

"It's neither. I'm just someone who wants to live humbly and prosperously. But I do know one thing."

I spoke, one word at a time, clearly and steadily.
"Until you try, you don't know anything."

"That's a good mindset. But will it be the same this time?"

"I hope I'm proven wrong."

"You might die."

"That's why I have to do my best. And if I die afterward... well, it'll be a dirty feeling, but someone will seek revenge for me. Isn't that right?"
Jeokcheon-gang nodded his head.

"Go in peace. Revenge will be taken care of, so don't worry about what comes next."

"Well, isn't that comforting?"

"That's why you should get rid of the nonsense and remember just one thing. If you die by his hands, you die by No Bu-i's hands."

"To avoid dying twice, I better give it my all."

Jong-ri laughed heartily, listening to our conversation.

"Uh-haha! This is quite amusing, a fascinating confrontation between disciples."

As I watched their interaction, I mentally clicked my brain.

Before fighting, I had to peel off the layers of secrecy surrounding him, even if just a little.

"Skill, Sensory Amplification."

Ding.

- [Sensory Amplification] has been activated.

- Currently at the 8th level, you can search for targets below .100 within a range of 80 units.

I possessed two forms of Sensory Amplification. One as a skill and the other as an innate ability.

In the early days of coming to the martial world, I heavily relied on the former, but over time, I realized that level and strength did not always correspond. Thus, I reduced its usage frequency.

The martial world was a place with many variables that couldn't be simply judged by level alone.

"Show me something, even just a little. Your true form!"

Swoosh!

A blue line, visible only to me, shot out without hesitation and enveloped Jong-ri.

Or rather, I thought it did in that instant.

Beep!

- [Sensory Amplification] has failed!

- Unable to detect the target!

- An unknown force is rejecting the skill!

What... What did it say?

Startled by the unbelievable system notification, I looked at Jong-ri with a bewildered gaze.

The blue line of Sensory Amplification seemed to have been blocked by something, circling around him before disappearing.

"...What the hell did you do?"

"That's the question I want to ask."

Suddenly, Jong-ri's gaze, which had stopped laughing, turned interestingly towards me.

"You possess quite an entertaining talent."

His words brought back a fleeting memory.

It was a memory from a year ago, the first time I sensed someone's Sensory Amplification.

"He's quite an interesting fellow."

Hwawang Jeokcheon-gang.

As an accomplished master, he could freely manipulate his own energy. It was through that encounter that I first realized the system wasn't all-powerful.

But even such a Jeokcheon-gang couldn't expel the skill.

However, now an unknown force rejected the skill. I had never heard of such a thing.

Every time I witnessed Jong-ri's actions that defied common sense, one word kept floating in my mind.

"Magong" (Unorthodox Martial Arts).

A martial art that went beyond the norms.

My suspicions solidified into conviction. Now I seemed to understand the meaning behind Jeokcheon-gang's earlier question.

"Are you really from the Mago?"

"If you defeat me, I'll let you know. What kind of trick did you play?"

"Even if I defeat you, I won't tell you."

"That's a significant loss for me. It's quite frustrating."

Swoosh,

The rusty sword slowly rose, aiming at my forehead.

A voice, singing-like and not befitting a life-or-death situation, followed.

"Now, let's play joyfully."

I boldly raised my Baiyan (6%) and replied.

"Sure. Let's play ruthlessly."

Whoosh!

The crouched dragon awakened from its slumber and stretched, its movements radiant.

- The Supreme Murah:

Jeokcheon-gang, who had pulled the clear wind with his empty hands, retreated as the air brightened. At the same time, the urgent shout of the examiner resounded.

"According to the revised schedule, we will now immediately commence the finals of the Seongra-Daejeon! The Rising Sword, no, the Ascendant Sword, Jong-ri, and Sanseo-Jam..."

The examiner's shout became insignificant as we were already charging towards each other.

Crackle!

One step, the distance closed.

Crash!

Two steps. Two beams of light, drawn from our respective hands, collided in mid-air.
