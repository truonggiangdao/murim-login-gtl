"That's the most precious friend I killed."

At those words, I stood frozen. The same thought must have crossed the mind of Jeokcheon-gang, who was next to me.

"What did I just hear?"

I didn't understand it in an instant. The words that came out of the mouth of the young man with a strange face tangled up in my mind.

So, now... "Koongdo is dead? That guy?"

Deep-seated memories flashed before my eyes and disappeared.

The vanished Jongri-chu during the swordsmanship practice, the struggling Koongdo at the threshold of death, and the four words he left as his last words: "Jongri-chu, Amcheon, Moomyeong, Buljang."

What were all those things I saw and heard until now?

Where did they flow from and how?

I tried my best to grasp the clues like a statue, but before I could connect my thoughts, a dry voice flowed through Jeokcheon-gang's lips.

"So, you killed Koongdo?"

His voice was abrupt, filled with impatience, anger, and suspicion.

The calm young man nodded and gently nodded his head.

"Yes, that's right. It was much easier than I thought. He said he would detonate Jincheon Thunder 98%#0) in the spectator stands, so he obediently followed along."

"Jincheon Thunder? Did he plant explosives?"

"Oh, that? Of course, it was a lie."

"What?"

"Why do people lie? Because there are fools who sometimes believe them."

A drop of blood fell from Jeokcheon-gang's clenched fist.

"It's not that I was fooled; it's that I allowed myself to be deceived. That's the kind of person Koongdo is."

"You allowed yourself to be deceived? Well, that could be possible. You're Tank Jung, who is almost like the head of the Sollim clan. It would seem plausible if you were trying to prevent any potential casualties."

"Nonsense!"

"Don't say such things. I didn't plan such a clumsy act either. But unexpectedly, things went awry. Of course, there..."

Suddenly, the young man's gaze turned towards me.

"Sanseo Jamryong, Jin Taekyung. You were involved too."

Just facing his gaze made my body stiffen.

I'm not sure if it's because of personal grudges against him or because I sensed an insurmountable difference in power.

"Perhaps it could be both."

I glared at the young man, biting my lip.

"What nonsense is this?"

"Because you suddenly interfered with the swordsmanship, the plan had to be moved up by a day. Among the biggest variables was Sangsung-gum Jongri-chu, that guy."

Sigh. This confirmed it. Jongri-chu was not only innocent but also not a co-conspirator.

"Well, in the end, everything was neatly resolved."

The young man smiled and extended his hand.

"What do you want?"

Realizing what he wanted, Han-su hastily handed over an item.

"Sollim's Divine Elixir, Nokok Buljang."

"I see, so this is..."

The young man gently brushed the Nokok Buljang, which emitted a faint glow.

But in the next moment, he stared intently at Han-su's face. It was because of his wrinkled hand that hadn't released the Nokok Buljang yet.

"Now, your mind can be clear."

Han-su replied, his mouth filled with saliva.

"Master, there's one favor I ask of you."

"A favor? Whatever it is, tell me. You've been through a lot, so I'll listen whole

heartedly."

It was a strange and bizarre sight. A senile old man pleading to a young man who could be his grandson.

If that old man was the Grand Martial Duke who turned Sollim into ruins, it was even more peculiar.

"What in the world is this guy's identity?

It could be either one. He is either of extremely high status within Amcheon or much older than he appears. Both possibilities are equally plausible.

Regardless, the daring words of the young man, known as Hyeolju, brightened Han-su's expression.

"Are you really sure?"

"I was the one who killed my most precious friend as an enemy."

Upon hearing those words, I stood frozen in place. I could imagine that the same thought crossed the mind of Jeokcheon-gang, who was standing next to me.

"What did I just hear?"

At that moment, I couldn't comprehend it. The words spoken by a young man with a unfamiliar face tangled my thoughts.

So, now... Did he say that Gungdo is dead? That guy?

Memories deeply engraved in my mind appeared and vanished before my eyes.

The disappearing Jongli-chu during combat, Gungdo struggling on the threshold of death, and the four words he left as his last words: "Jongli-chu, Amcheon, Moomyung, Buljang."

What were all those things I saw and heard until now?

Where did they come from and how did they unfold?

I tried desperately to grasp any clue, like a stone statue, but before I could connect my thoughts, a dry voice flowed through Jeokcheon-gang's lips.

"So, you killed Gungdo?"

His voice was abrupt, filled with impatience, anger, and suspicion.

In response to Jeokcheon-gang's appearance, the young man calmly smiled and nodded his head.

"Yes, that's right. It was much easier than I thought. He said he would detonate Jincheon Lightning Bomb 98%#0) in the spectator stands, so he obediently followed along."

"Jincheon Lightning Bomb? Did he plant explosives?"

"Oh, that? Of course, it was a lie."

"What?"

"Why do people lie? Because there are foolish ones who fall for it sometimes."

A droplet of blood fell from Jeokcheon-gang's clenched fist.

"I didn't fall for it; I deceived him. Because Gungdo is that kind of person."

"Deceived him? Well, that could be possible. If you say you did it to prevent any potential harm, it sounds plausible, being a senior warrior like you."

"Nonsense!"

"Don't make such assumptions. I didn't plan such a clumsy act. But unexpectedly, things got complicated. Of course, there..."

Suddenly, the young man's gaze turned towards me.

"Sanseo Jamryong, Jintae-gyeong. You were also involved."

Meeting his gaze made my body stiffen.

I don't know if it was due to personal grudges against him or the overwhelming difference in power that made it impossible to confront him.

"Perhaps both are true."

I glared at the young man, biting my lip.

"What nonsense is this?"

"Because of your sudden interference in the combat, we had to advance our plans by a day. The biggest variable among them was Gungdo, the Rising Sword Jongli-chu."

C-I, it became clear. Jongli-chu was not only the culprit but not even an accomplice.

"Well, in the end, everything has been neatly resolved."

The young man smirked and extended his hand.

"Silim's divine artifact, Nokok Fire Bell."

"So, this is..."

I slowly examined the glowing Nokok Fire Bell with my finger.

However, in the next moment, the young man stared intently at Hansu, his aged hands still gripping the Nokok Fire Bell.

"Now even your mind is clear."

Hansu replied, swallowing his saliva.

"To the tongue, to the blood. I have one request, Master Hansu."

"A request? Tell me, whatever it is. You've worked hard, so I'll listen wholeheartedly."

It was a bizarre and strange sight. An old man, who seemed to be at least a grandson in relation to the young man.

If anyone witnessed this scene, they would be dumbfounded.

I carefully watched their interactions.

"The request is not difficult."

"But it's hard for you to do it yourself?"

"It's embarrassing, but yes."

"I see. I have a rough idea of what it is."

The young man's tongue touched his lips.

He nodded and muttered to himself, "Ah, I see. I had a rough idea."

Then, the young man turned towards me and grinned.

"Ha! This is unexpected. It seems you've become quite close to him."

"It's been almost half of my life. It would be nice to repay him with this."

"Loyalty... Well, that's fine."

I couldn't comprehend the conversation between the two, as if they were speaking in code.

On one hand, I couldn't help but shudder at their conversation, but on the other hand, a sense of coldness enveloped me.

Those words... They were sincere.

Il-Da-Gyeong. He confidently stated that he could kill the Flame King Jeokcheon-gang within the time it takes to drink a cup of tea.

The rigid expression on Jeokcheon-gang's face was proof that the young man's words were not mere empty promises.

- 41897 991, escape while you can.

At that moment, I slightly tilted my head as if understanding something.

Since the fierce battle had already begun, it would be difficult to expect help from the Sollim Temple.

If I were to retreat, Jeokcheon-gang would undoubtedly be subjected to the concentrated attacks of two supreme experts.

"Staying here until the end is the best option."

Jeokcheon-gang knew that too. Despite knowing this, he still spoke those words because... he was a person who cared more deeply and worried more than others.

"This... It will be really dangerous this time."

I clenched my dry lips and firmly grasped the Bakyeom.

Seeing my appearance, Hansu sneered.

"Foolish man. What difference does it make? Even if you achieve such accomplishments, it won't be enough to avoid a miserable death."

"Try me."

I struck back with a defiant glare.

"If I wake up after sleeping for a few hours in this time frame, you will die at my hands."

"What nonsense is this?"

"If you don't believe me, try it."

"How dare you, you insolent brat!"

It's a pity indeed. If this were not during the battle, but a moment when time stopped completely instead of flowing slowly when logging out, I could have utilized infinite time to escape from this crisis.

However, all the thoughts I have right now are merely personal desires.

Now is the time to face reality, not delusions.

"Freeze in the mountains."

Crunch. Crunch. Crackling.

Now I finally understand why the nickname of the person who controls ice is "Yumgye" (meaning "frozen disease").

With each step he takes, the ground freezes, and frost settles on the blades of grass.

"A severe Yumhanjigi (frost guardian)."
"But..."
Jeokcheon-gang blocked my path.

"You dare touch a disciple of Lord Nobu."

Hwaaack!

The Yumhanjigi under Hansu's control is like an iceberg, while Jeokcheon-gang's Yuryangjigi (flame guardian) is like the sun.

Assuming that the deceased Yeomho and Hansu's martial arts were on par, Jeokcheon-gang's victory was only natural.

However, Hansu's expression was relaxed. He knew that there was a tiger behind him.

"I guess it's time for the Blood Lord to step in."

"Oh, yes. We should start slowly."

The Blood Lord, holding the Nokok Fire Bell as if it were a treasure, moved. No, he disappeared.

And in the next moment.

Swoosh! Thud!

A chilling sound accompanied the appearance of a round object from the ground.

Pale hair and a seemingly gentle appearance. A faint smile, still lingering on his face, that he hadn't erased from the past.

Saaai, Ssuaai, both Jeokcheon-gang and I widened our eyes simultaneously.

The formidable martial arts expert and the supreme master, Yumgye Hansu, lost his neck with a single strike.

And it was done by the hands of his trusted ally, whom we believed in like solid rock.

While we were in awe, the culprit behind all of this, the Blood Lord, remained utterly calm.

"Foolish child. That's why you shouldn't pick up those without a foundation."

He casually pushed the lifeless body of Hansu, who had turned into a headless corpse.

A gushing fountain of blood, like a tall tree falling, stained the ground.

"You'll go as the capturer commands. You'll go wherever the capturer wants. How dare you...!"

Phew! Thud! Crackle!

With a forceful kick, my flesh swelled and my bones shattered.

The Blood Lord, who had already lost his vitality, repeatedly examined and crushed Hansu's corpse, letting the flowing hair fall.

"Some people really don't understand the concept of limits. They don't know their own capabilities or how far they should go. Sanseo Jamryong, do you think the same way?"

What should I say? I hesitated for a moment, then honestly replied.

"No. You just seem like a crazy bastard."

A smile crept up on the corner of the Blood Lord's mouth as he stared at me in disbelief.

"Young one, you're quite audacious."

"You still look quite old, even though you seem to have lost your mind."

"You think I'm young, at the very least."

"You must be really old, then."

"Well, that's right. I've lived at least twice as long as you have."

I looked him up and down with a skeptical gaze.

A body that is almost the same height as mine, perfectly balanced.

His face looks like that of a young man in his early twenties, at best.

This cannot be simply explained by the word "appearance." But isn't the martial world a place where anything can happen?

"Why? Were you surprised because there are more of us than you expected?"

It is truly unfortunate. If I were not in the midst of battle, instead of time slowing down when logging out, if it were to completely stop, I could utilize infinite time to escape from this crisis.

However, all the thoughts I have now are purely selfish.

Now is the time to face reality, not delusions.

"Freeze as a mountain."

Thump. Thump. Crackling.

Now I finally understand why the nickname of that detestable villain is 'Emgye,' the Frozen.

With each step he takes, the ground freezes, and frost settles on the branches.

"A vicious Emgye gatekeeper.
One...
The enemy, Jeokcheon Gang, blocked my path.

"You dare not touch the disciple of Noble No."

Whoosh!

One of Jeokcheon Gang's gatekeepers, if Emgye is an iceberg, is like the sun.

Assuming that the deceased Yeomho and Han-su's martial arts were equal, Jeokcheon Gang's victory was inevitable.

However, Han-su's expression was calm because he knew there was a tiger behind him.

"The Blood Pearl must step forward."

"Oh, yes. We should start soon."

The Blood Pearl, who held the Green Jade Fire Ring as a treasure, moved. No, it disappeared.

And the next moment.

Swoosh! Boom!

A chilling sound accompanied the appearance of a round object rolling on the ground.
Pale white hair and a seemingly gentle face. A relaxed smile hung on his face, which couldn't be wiped away.

Sigh,
Whew,
Both I and Jeokcheon Gang widened our eyes simultaneously.

In an instant, Han-su, the formidable and unparalleled master of Emgye, lost his neck with a single strike.

And it was done by the hands of our trusted comrade.

While we were astonished, the culprit of all this, the Blood Pearl, remained nonchalant.

"Foolish Em, that's why you shouldn't pick up worthless things."

The Blood Pearl pitifully pushed aside Han-su's lifeless body.

Splurt. Like a fountain of blood gushing out, staining the ground.

"If you're going to pick a fight, you should be prepared to be struck by the sword. How dare you...!

Thud! Thump! Crunch!

His powerful kick shattered flesh and bones.

The Blood Pearl, who had already lost his vitality, repeatedly examined and crushed Han-su's flowing hair.

"It seems there are some who don't understand their own limitations. They don't know how far they should go. Sanso Jamryong, do you think the same way?"

What should I say? I hesitated for a moment and spoke frankly.

"No, you just seem like a crazy bastard."

A smile appeared on the Blood Pearl's lips as he stared at me in silence.

"Young one, you're quite audacious."

"You, on the other hand, already seem a bit past your prime."

"I see. At least I've lived twice as long as you have in your entire life."

I scrutinized him skeptically.

A body perfectly balanced at my eye level.

His face looks like that of a young man in his early twenties at best.

This cannot be simply described as a martial artist. But isn't the world of Wulin a place where anything can happen?

"Why? Were you surprised that there are more of us than you thought?"
