“That is also the enemy who killed the most precious friend.”

At that word, I stood tall.
The same thought as mine must have popped into the head of Jeokcheongang next to me.

“What did you hear?”

I didn't understand for a moment. The words that came out of the mouth of a young man with a strange face tangled in my head.
So now... … …
'Gungdo is dead? is that guy?"

Memories that are deeply imprinted in the brain come up in front of my eyes and then disappear.

The Jonglichu that disappeared during the dance, Gingdo gasping at the threshold of death, and the four words he left behind as a will,
'Jonglichu, Amcheon, Mumyeong, Buljang."

What the heck have I seen and heard so far?

Where the hell did it go and how did it go?
I tried to catch a clue, stiff as a stone statue, but before I could think, a dry voice flowed from between Jeokcheongang's lips.

“You bastard, killed the sword?”

His hoarse voice was wet with patience, anger, and disbelief.
At the sight of Cheongang at that time, the young man smiled calmly and nodded his head.

“Because it is. It was much easier than I thought. When I said that I would explode Jincheonroe 98%#0) into the crowd, they obediently followed me.”

“Jincheonroe? Did you plant the explosives?”
“Oh, that? It was a lie, of course."

"what?"

“Why do people lie? Because sometimes there are fools who are fooled."

Drops of blood dripped from the clenched fist of Jeokcheongang.

“I was not deceived, I was deceived. Because he is such a person.”

“Have you been tricked? what could it be It would be plausible to say that he was trying to prevent an accidental killing since he was a tank of the ranks of the chief of Shaolin Temple.”
<Noom!”

“Don’t say too much. Because I didn't plan anything so lame. But things took a turn in an unexpected place. Of course there... … "”

Suddenly, the young man's gaze turned to me.

“Shanseo Jamrong Jin Tae-gyeong. You were tied up too.”

It felt like my body stiffened just by looking into their eyes.

I don't know if it's because of the hostility toward him, or because I feel the difference in power that I dare not stand against.

"Maybe it's both."
I bit my lip and glared at the young man.

“What bullshit is that?”

“I had to move the plan a day ahead because you suddenly intervened. Among them, the biggest variable was the ascending sword, the bell weight, that guy."

C.I.,
This made it clear. Jong-ri-chu was not an accomplice, let alone the real culprit.

“Well, in the end, everything worked out neatly.”

He grinned and held out his hand.
Realizing what he wanted, Hansoo hurriedly held out an item.

“The god of Shaolin, the chrysanthemum fire pit.”

“Okay, this is it… ”

His long fingers slowly swept across the softly shining chrysanthemum.

However, the next moment, the young man stared blankly at Hansoo's face. It was because of his wrinkled hands that hadn't let go of the chrysanthemum yet.

“You can have a brain now.”

Hansoo swallowed his saliva and answered.

“Tongue, I have one request for you.”
“Cheong. tell me anything I've worked hard, so you have to listen to me wholeheartedly."

It's a strange and bizarre sight.
An old man who is clinging to a young man who could at least be punished by his grandson.

Even more so if the old man turned the Shaolin Temple into a sea of blood.

'What the hell is this guy?

Either one. The status within Amcheon is extremely high, or older than it looks. There's a good chance that both are right.

Hansoo's expression brightened at the boldness of the young man, who was called a blood lord.
“I-really?”

Blood wine clicks the tongue.

“Did you just buy a trick? The mission has been successfully completed, so the reward is natural. But how difficult would our seniors be to ask for a favor like this?”

“It’s not that difficult a request.”

“But is it difficult to do it yourself?”

“It’s embarrassing, but it is.”

“Aha, I got a rough idea of what it was.”

Blood wine came out and chined towards the Jeokcheongang.
“Please kill those two. this is it now? Is that correct?"

When Hansoo nodded his head with a lively look, Hyeolju smiled.

“Hey, is this unexpected? You must have been stronger than I thought.”

"He's been around for half his life. I think I'll be satisfied with this much."

“I will be loyal… Well, that's good too."

“Please kill me as brutally as possible.
I'll lend a hand too."

“Can you do that? If the rightists come soon, it will be a pain in the ass. If you want to finish quickly, you should shed a few drops too.”

"then?"

“Senior is the Sanseo Jamryong. I am the king of fire
Do you think it will be over within a day or two at the latest?”

“I am that young man? hahaha! good!”

The conversation between the two of them, who thought of me and Jeokcheongang's life as if it were something in their pockets, was absurd, and on the other hand, chills ran down my spine.

that word... … It's sincere."
Dakyung Il. He asserted that he could kill the King of Fire, Jeokcheongang, in a short time to drink a cup of tea.

Jeokcheongang's hardened expression was proof that his words were not mere lies.

- 41897 991 Brother Running Away
At the moment, Gae Wadang shook his head slightly at the tone.

It is difficult to expect help from Shaolin Temple as a bloody battle is already taking place from above.

If I break my foot, Jeokcheongang will inevitably receive a concentrated attack from two superstars.

'It's best to hold out here until the end.

Jeokcheongang knows that too. Still, what I'm saying is... - It is because he is a warm and caring person more than others think.

'This is going to be really dangerous this time.

He licked his dry lips and clutched at his white salt. Hansoo who saw me like that was a raincoat.

“Laughing bastard. What's the difference? Your accomplishments are quite good, but he is dead to that extent. Even if he wakes up, he can't match the old woman."

“Pick it up”

I shoveled out the phlegm proudly.

“If you wake up after sleeping for a few hours here, will you die by my hand?”

“What bullshit is that?”

"If you don't believe me, try it."

“How dare you, this blue kid!”

It's just pitiful. If it weren't for combat, if time stopped completely instead of slowing down when you logged out, you could use infinite time to get out of this crisis.

But the things I think about now are all personal greed.

Now was the time to face reality, not delusion.

“I’ll freeze you alive.”

that buck that buck damn

Now I think I can clearly understand why the nickname of that damn sick Nul-eun is Eum-gwi (minus).

With every step he took, the ground froze and frost settled on the branches of the pond.

“You’re a terrible slanderer (Suk Chongbe).
one…
The Jeokcheon River blocked my way.

“Something like you wouldn't dare touch the old lady's apprentice.”

Whoa!

If Hansu's yin and yang keeper is Iceberg, Jeokcheongang's yin and yang keeper is the sun.

Assuming that Yeom-ho and Han-soo, who died earlier, were equal in martial arts, the landslide victory of the Jeokcheon River was very natural.
However, Hansoo's expression was relaxed. Because he knows that there is a tiger behind him.

“The blood lord must come forward and give it to you.”

“Ah, sure. We have to start slowly."

The Blood Juice, which put the Green Jade Buddha in its bosom like a treasure, moved. No, it's gone.

and the next moment.

Awesome! Special!

A round object came to a stop at my feet with a creepy sound.
Gray gray hair and a well-mannered appearance. A carefree smile hung over the family that could not be erased.

suai,
ssia,
Jeokcheongang and I called out our eyes at the same time.

Eumgwi Hansoo, a great horse head with a bad name and an ultra-high master, was decapitated with a single blow.

In the hands of an ally whom he trusted like iron stone.

Unlike us, who were stunned, the main culprit of all of this, Hyeolju, was very calm.
“A dog-like silver. That's why you shouldn't collect things that don't have a root."

Wearing a helmet, he gently pushed the body of Hansoo, who had become a headless corpse.

worst. A fountain of blood from a fallen tree like a dead tree soaked the ground.

“If you sharpen it, it’s like a knife. The one who catches it will go as he wields it. How dare you... !

Perm! rice cake! Cranky!

The energy-loaded kicks made him gain weight and break his bones.
He brushed up his hair, which was dripping with bright blood that had already crushed Hansoo's corpse, which had already lost its life.

“There are things you don’t necessarily know the fraction of. He doesn't know what his level is or how far he should go. Shanxi Jamrong, don’t you think so too?”

What should I say? I hesitated and was frankly daring.

"no. You just look like a crazy bastard.”

A smile spread across his lips as he stared blankly at me for a moment.
“The young man is bold.”

"You're still young, but I think you've already lost some taste."

“Thank you for looking at me young. I am older than I thought.”

“We must have seen many.”

“Arthur. At least you have lived twice as many lives as you have ever lived.”

I slapped him up and down in disbelief.

An extremely well-proportioned body at eye level similar to mine.

His face looks like that of a youngster in his early to mid-twenties at most.

This level cannot be simply described with the word “while”. But isn't Moorim a place where anything can happen?

“Why are you surprised that there are so many more than you thought?”

I shook my head.

"no. If what you're saying is true, I thought you were a bastard who wasn't worth your age."

“Hahahaha!”

The Blood Lord let out a delightful laugh.
actions, speech. It's frivolous because it's not fair. So it feels more dangerous.
I couldn't see a gap even now as he was bending over his back from laughing.

Jeon Kang, who was glaring at the smiling guy with his shoulders shaking, suddenly opened his mouth.

“You will regret it”

"regret?"

Blood Ju, who had stopped laughing, frowned at her.

“Why do I regret it?”

"If you wanted to finish it off, you shouldn't have killed the demon."

“It's a rusty knife anyway, so it's only natural to dispose of it because it's no longer useful."

“A master of transcendence is a rusty sword… What about the old lady?"

Blood Lord stroked his chin and said.

“Hwawang, you deserve to be praised. If Jeongma Daejeon had continued for one more year, it would probably have been Saseong (09) instead of Samsung (=bo).”

“Looks like the day hasn’t died yet”

“You are enough to hear the famous sword.”

“What if that famous sword pierced your heart?”
“Well… ~ It's harder than I look. I don't think a single drop of blood will bleed."

“When Goo Doo died, the old man swore to the sky”

Jeokcheongang's eyes sank deeply as he looked at the smiling bloodju.

“Even if the beast is a non-human demon, I will end this revenge.”

“That’s true, it’s impressive.”

The blood lord, who had a smile on his face, touched the sword wave of the hiri dance.

“I wonder if today, Yeolhwamun’s lifeline will be cut off.”

Jeokcheongang asked me without taking his eyes off him.

“That horse, what do you think?”

“I think I will have to circumcise my mouth. You've been saying the same thing since before."

The smile disappeared from his face,
“… … I mean, he's a fun guy."

that buck The guy who took a step toward the Jeokcheon River with me suddenly opened his mouth, “By the way, how long is that little mouse going to hide there?”

A rustling, rustless man emerged from the distant grass and bent the back of his head.

“Benefactor. sorry. It's the first time in my life I've been so scared... … ,”

It was the first time that Cheongpung had been so welcome.
