[Crafting of Hidden Techniques]
Rank: ※Limit: Achieved Greatness in Martial Arts
Description: The practitioner can craft hidden techniques only for the martial arts in which they have achieved greatness. If one has a deep understanding of the martial arts, better results may be obtained.
Note: Materials are required for crafting hidden techniques.

As I looked at the skill information window, I pondered.

When did I receive this?

Was it when I achieved Greatness in the True Meridian Technique? Or was it the True Palm Technique?"

It had been over a year, so my memory was a bit fuzzy.

Somehow, I ended up receiving the skill, but I had never used it even once because I had no place to use it.

"Well, to be precise, it's not that I didn't have a place to use it, but rather that I didn't think of using it.

Every time I encountered members of the Peace Guild in the present day, I occasionally felt that impulse. But the final conclusion I always reached was "No."

"Leaking martial arts and causing trouble? 

Imagine someone fighting with a bronze weapon, and someone else comes with a steel sword and easily defeats them.

Everyone would envy them and gather like a pack to obtain that steel sword.

It's not that I don't trust the Peace Guild members, but at least at that time, it was a reasonable judgment.

"But now, there's no reason to hesitate."

I confronted Lee Jeong-ryong, Park Ji-hoon, Seok Go-joon, and others directly. Even in the modern era, there were secrets that I didn't know.

Their movements and mana manipulation were clearly close to that of martial artists. If the enemy armed themselves with steel swords, we also needed similar equipment.

"Stage 2.

Goo goo 7." "171

I took a deep breath as a foul smell entered my nostrils.

I was now sitting in a smelly restroom stall.

The environment was terrible, but it was suitable for crafting hidden techniques without attracting attention.

Now, where should I start?

I unfolded the A4 paper and pen that I bought at the hospital convenience store.

And I muttered to myself.

"Activate the Hidden Technique Crafting skill."

Ding.

- All materials are ready.

- [Crafting of Hidden Techniques] skill is activated.
You can craft hidden techniques from the ones you have achieved Greatness in.

- Current craftable list: True Simplicity Method, True Seeing Method, True Spear Method.

- Please select the desired martial art.

Among the martial arts I had learned, there was none that had achieved Greatness.

On the other hand, the Taewon True Meridian techniques were stable, and the power they possessed was moderate.

Among them, I chose the foundational one.

"Select True Simplicity Method."

Ding.

- Would you like to craft the True Simplicity Method as a hidden technique?

6 / Ding

Yes

Beep! Beep!

- Insufficient intelligence! Insufficient skill proficiency!

- Teaching is several times more difficult than learning!

- Minimum 100 intelligence is required to craft a Hidden Technique of the [Pinnacle] rank!

"> Ah, damn it. Seriously."

With tears in my eyes, I opened the status window.

Investing points in intelligence like blood, my pen moved across the paper as if it were turning into a blaze.

Choi!

"Hey!"

I was surprised twice.

Once by the tremendous speed, and twice by the fact that all the writing was in Chinese.

Damn it, I can't handle this.

I started looking for the language settings.

※ * ※Drrr.

I entered the hospital room where the members of the Peace Guild were gathered, engaged in lively conversation. They all turned their heads towards me.

"Where were you that you're so late...- Did you go to the restroom by any chance?"

I confidently replied, raising an eyebrow.

"How did you know?"

"The smell of feces was vibrating."

"Really?"

"Yes. I thought it wasn't a person but a giant piece of shit walking."

"That's a good one. You have a good sense of humor."

"Uweh, uweh!"

"Look at that reaction."

"Uweh, uweheh!"

It wasn't just a reaction; it was real.

I thought I had seen everything, but there are always unexpected things that itch at the corner of your mind.

"I loved you..."

"Uwehehe!"

"Song Songi Hunter, are you okay?"

Kim Jipsa, who was closest to me when I started to retch, rushed over and patted my back.

Meanwhile, the stack of 24 stapled papers that Song Songi was swinging like the Taegukgi (Korean flag) ended up in someone else's hands.

Chief Choi, who read the characters written on the first page, looked at me with a wry smile.

"The True Simplicity Method? The title is peculiar for a love letter."

"The content written inside is even more peculiar."

"Really? Keep reading."

Chief Choi was quick on the uptake. He immediately straightened up and turned the pages with a careful expression.

As his pair of eyeballs rolled busily across the mechanically-like handwriting, the speed gradually increased, and warm breaths escaped from Chief Choi's lips.

In an instant, he devoured over ten pages and smacked his lips. The gaze in his eyes, looking at me, was as if they were inflated like a tray.

"The Vital Technique...!"

I was also quite surprised by his reaction.

"You know what this is?"

The words were indeed the Vital Technique, but when I actually produced it, the Vital Technique of the True Simplicity Method looked like a book on traditional Korean medicine to someone who didn't know.

If it were Song Songi, she would have looked at a few pages and closed it, but Chief Choi's reaction was beyond my expectations.

"Do you want to find out what it is?"

"Um... Yes, please."

Then, a name I had never heard before flowed through his lips.

"This is... the Mana Cultivation Method."

"Mana, what?"

"The Mana Cultivation Method!"

Mana Cultivation Method (4303-Hapah 00)?

Well, the name sounds strange. I wonder who came up with it.

Just then, Kim Jipsa, who heard Chief Choi's raised voice, approached quickly.

"Did you say Mana Cultivation Method just now?"

"Yeah, here."


Kim, the butler who received an unexpected bonus from Chief Choi, quickly turned the page. Before long, a similar reaction erupted.

"What do you think, Mr. Kim?" someone asked.

"I'm certain. It's definitely Mana Martial Arts. But where did this come from?"

"I found it in the restroom."

Chief Choi pointed his finger at me.

"Mr. Jin Tae-kyung..."

"You mean Hunter Jin Tae-kyung?"

Bam! Suddenly, without waiting for Chief Choi's response, Kim's head turned towards me with a fierce sound.

"How does Hunter Jin Tae-kyung possess Mana Martial Arts?"

I calmly replied, "First of all, I don't even know what Mana Martial Arts is. Naturally, I have no idea if that's actually Mana Martial Arts. By the way, are you okay? I just heard a bone-cracking sound..."

"Is it a significant income? You can break your neck if you want."

"... It seems pretty lucrative."

Well, what can you do? This old man seems to be getting tougher as time goes by. Of course, it probably means that this issue is important.

"Speaking of which, Mana Martial Arts... So Jeong-ryong learned it. At first, it sounded strange as a compound word, but after murmuring it a few times, it feels familiar on my tongue. It wasn't that difficult to deduce that it refers to the inner cultivation method used by hunters."

"And Jeong-ryong and his subordinates have mastered this Mana Martial Arts."

"May I ask for your opinion on my question?"

"Tae-kyung, this is a very important issue."

The gaze of Kim the butler and Chief Choi was more serious and grave than ever before.

I pretended to be flustered, rolling my eyes, and then confidently threw out the prepared bold statement.

"Here's the thing. When I was young, my father taught me..."

"I hate to interrupt, but are you referring to your deceased ancestor?"

"Yes."

Chief Choi narrowed his eyes.

"Although your ancestor was an ordinary person."

"That's right."

"But how did you learn Mana Martial Arts?"

"Perhaps even my father didn't know. He taught it to me as a family heirloom health practice."

"A health practice?"

"Yes, he called it Mana Martial Arts, passed down through generations in our family."

"I see... It's hard to believe."

I pointed to the cover page facing the two unbelieving individuals.

Four characters were neatly written in a font resembling office documents.

[The Art of True Power]

Even the name is perfect.

Just as there is Tae-won Jin-ga in Sanseo Province, there is Goyang Jin-ga in Gyeonggi Province, so to speak. If you mention the hereditary practice within the family, they won't have much to say on the other side.

As I expected, seeing the two people momentarily speechless, I continued.

"It's a kind of breathing technique. My father taught me that if you practice it, you'll become healthier. He even made me memorize the gestures and sounds to help with pronunciation."

"It's somewhat similar to Mana Martial Arts..."

"Can I see the original, the source?"

"After my father passed away, there were no circumstances to check... I searched for it after moving, but it was gone."

"Oh... I see."

"Too bad."

"It's unfortunate. Luckily, I memorized every word he told me, so that's a relief."

The claim that there is a missing item is true. They simply inserted the fictitious secret technique of Jin Ga Sim Beop (a martial arts technique) into the story.

The perfect evidence was destroyed. Even the original document has disappeared, causing the two individuals to look shocked.

"It would be interesting to see their expressions if they knew this was the original."

The form of martial arts secret techniques that people imagine is generally similar.

Half-burned ancient books. Musty-smelling books covered in rat urine.

Do some fancy kicks. I don't have anything like that. I neatly stacked 24 pieces of paper and stapled them. If martial artists saw it, they would be impressed, but for a 21st-century martial arts secret technique, this much should be enough.

"By the way, Sim Beom-i, this is amazing. I never imagined such a thing."

"I've seen it mentioned several times in novels and movies. It was called martial arts secret techniques."

"Exactly what the young master thought. Mana Gongbeop (a form of martial arts) can also be considered a type of martial arts. If you look at this part, it says to circulate and accumulate energy through breathing techniques, similar to Mana Gongbeop..."

Oh, that's martial arts.

While I restrained the itching in my mouth, Chief Choi asked.

"Then, Jin Tae-kyung, have you been practicing Mana Gongbeop or rather Jin Ga Sim Beop since you were young?"

I replied, "I apologize for saying this, but the effects have not been as great as expected..."

Literally, it means "Why did someone like you live as a Level Hunter for seven years?" It's a sharp question. It was a question I anticipated.

I responded with a calm face.

"As you know, my skills were exceptionally good for a Level Hunter. I received a commendation as the top student even in the training camp."

"Oh, I know about that part. You were also a sub-leader in the guild where you used to belong."

Even though it was just a small guild, being a sub-leader as a Level Hunter is rare. That's why my position as a sub-leader caused a stir in the guild for a while.

"There were a lot of rumors because of that. People with higher ranks and more experience would complain, comparing achievements and talking about seniority... In the end, I proved myself with my skills. The reason I could do that was because of Jin Ga Sim Beop."

"That does seem to have an effect."

I know. It's difficult to fully convey the effectiveness of my past and Jin Ga Sim Beop.

I smiled and looked at the people. Suddenly, Song Song, who had stopped feeling nauseous, and even Im Jik-jeong, looked at me with curious eyes, eagerly awaiting my words.
