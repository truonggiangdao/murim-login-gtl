- An unexpected quest, [Take only half of the assimilated power], has been created.

- Will you accept?

Damn it, why now of all times?

I feel like I desperately want to check the quest window.

But right now, I'm in the middle of Jin Kidoin. If I let go of control here, I'm likely to get injured.

- If you don't respond within 5 seconds, the quest will be automatically canceled.

- One, two, three...

Should I go for it? Should I not?

The title of the quest and the presence of it in Team Leader Choe's dantian seem to imply that I should try messing with it. At a glance, it's clearly an overwhelmingly powerful energy.

- I... will...

Damn it, I don't know. Could it even be deadly? Accept it!

Ding.

It was close. With the notification that the quest had been accepted, I realized what I needed to do.

- The unidentified energy has been dormant for a long time, and the owner of the body has no power to handle it. Now is the time for you to take control!

Of course, it's a situation I've encountered once before in the past.

I recalled a distant memory from my time in the martial world.

"The Hundred-Year Snow Ginseng."

Since I first opened my eyes in the martial world, the power of the Hundred-Year Snow Ginseng has been lurking in my dantian.

It was the power that Jin Tae-gyeong, a third-rate loser, couldn't fully digest.

Back then, I learned for the first time that even if you take medicine, you can't make it your own if you don't have the ability.

"Just like Team Leader Choe now."

Compared to a third-rate loser, he's a remarkable talent, but as someone who doesn't know mana manipulation techniques, Team Leader Choe doesn't have the ability to control such an overwhelmingly powerful energy.

The quest has entrusted me with the role of a digestive aid.

"But how did Team Leader Choe obtain an energy equal to mine?"

Come to think of it, I'm getting annoyed.

I rolled and rolled like a dog in the martial world to finally accumulate a bit more than an urgent level, but what did this guy do to have such an outrageous energy deposited in his dantian?

"Oh, my great-grandfather was Cheon Tae-min."

Is this the so-called legacy of a hero?

I gave up on thinking about it. Right now, I need to focus on targeting the unidentified energy that originates from an unknown source.

And this time, I'm confident.

Let's go.

The flaming energy shot into the solid mass of energy like a spear. The two masses of energy, both surpassing an urgent level, clashed and wrestled with each other.

Boom. Team Leader Choe's body began to tremble violently from the collision that turned the dantian into an impenetrable fortress.

In the hospital room transformed into an impregnable stronghold where no one could enter or exit, Kim Jipsa, Lim Geokjeong, and Song Songi were watching the two young men with curious expressions.

"Hmm..."

- Eugh.

<In Jin Tae-gyeong's arm, the blood vessels bulged, and every time it pulsed, Team Leader Choe's body trembled, and a groan escaped from his lips as his waist bent.

Song Songi, who was watching the scene, muttered to herself.

"His waist curved like a bow..."

Lim Geokjeong, who was lying on the bed, asked, "What did you just say, Song?"

"Oh, nothing. It's just dirty and fascinating."

"You mean that black thing?"

> Haha, yeah.

Song Songi had a lot to say, but she nodded her head instead.

Because the black energy flowing through Team Leader Choe's entire body right now was both dirty and fascinating.

"Wow, what is that..."

As a hunter, you see all sorts of things. However, it was the first time I had seen someone emitting black energy.

Sticky and foul, it didn't amount to much on its own, but it emitted an immense stench.

"Oh, the smell is really disgusting."

As the two held their noses, Kim Jipsa spoke up.

"That is a separate discharge of waste that has accumulated inside the body. It's one of the effects of mana manipulation techniques."

"Waste?"

"Kim Hyung, is that so amazing?"

"Of course. Even healing magic can't eliminate waste from the body."

After thinking for a moment, Song Songi spoke boldly.

"It's possible. If you're truly a top-tier healer. But if what you're saying is true... it's incredible. Even the potions used for treatment still contain traces of toxicity from the Trom."

"That's one of the remarkable aspects of mana manipulation techniques."

"And who exactly created this mana manipulation technique and how?"

Song Songi had a considerable hunter career, but she had never heard of the term "mana manipulation techniques" before. Even for a 20-year veteran like Lim Geokjeong, it was unfamiliar.

"Yeah, that's right. I've never heard of such martial arts or sorcery in all my years as a hunter."

"During the great upheaval, the elder was the one who first created mana manipulation techniques. It's treated as an extremely confidential matter, so it's natural that you two don't know."

"If it's the elder..."

"Indeed, you're thinking of the right person."

Cheon Tae-min, the hero who saved humanity and the world's greatest hunter.

Kim Jipsa slowly spoke.

"Mana manipulation techniques are powerful weapons in themselves. There were many incidents surrounding them, most of which have disappeared from history. It was truly an era of great upheaval, the Age of the Great Transformation."

They wanted to ask what had happened, why Cheon Tae-min's mana manipulation techniques ended up in the hands of a ambitious schemer like Yi Jeong-ryong.

There were many more questions they wanted to ask, but Song Songi and Lim Geokjeong kept their mouths shut at that point.

It wasn't just because Kim Jipsa's expression was indescribably gloomy. It was also because an alarming change occurred as soon as he finished speaking.

Both Jin Tae-gyeong and Team Leader Choe groaned at the same time. Veins bulged over exposed flesh, and deep furrows formed on their foreheads.

In particular, Team Leader Choe's reaction became more and more intense. His entire body trembled as if an earthquake had occurred.

"Is something wrong?"

Song Songi and Lim Geokjeong took a step forward in surprise, but Kim Jipsa quickly stopped them.

"No, it's not allowed. There can be no contact during the practice of mana manipulation techniques."

"But..."

"Hunter Jin Tae-gyeong is not someone who would put the young master in danger."

Kim Jipsa looked at the two with a gaze that mixed concern and trust.

The trembling and pain intensified.

Not long after, his belief soon turned into reality.

"Haaa..."

At some point, the corners of Team Leader Choe's mouth opened, and steady breaths flowed out.

It was a signal that the first stage of the energy cultivation process had just ended, and he had become a skilled practitioner of Jin-gasim techniques.

"Young master?"

At Kim Jipsa's call, his closed eyes slowly opened. His pupils were filled with astonishment and joy.

"This is...!?"

Team Leader Choe, Choi Min-woo, tightly clenched his fists.

A tremendous surge of energy surged through him as if he had just struck a powerful blow.

Not only could he freely manipulate mana that should have flowed throughout his body, but the amount of mana had also increased by almost double.

"This is the power of mana manipulation techniques. No, it's the power of Jin-gasim techniques. And it was possible because of one person's ability."

"Mr. Jin Tae-gyeong."

Choi Min-woo turned around slowly. Jin Tae-gyeong still had his eyes closed, deeply inhaling and exhaling.

The air around him trembled. It felt like there was an erupting volcano ready to explode.

Strong. Unbelievably strong.

Was this the extent of it?

As Jin Tae-gyeong gained proper control over mana, he caught a glimpse of the power he possessed.

Each time he exhaled, a blazing flame surged out, heating up the hospital room.

Despite the fact that it had snowed for the first time a week ago in November, people felt thirsty, and cracks appeared on the ground.

At that moment, Choi Min-woo's eyes gradually narrowed.

"What is that...?"

An illusion created by the cracks? Or is it reality?

He didn't know. Suddenly, not only Choi Min-woo but everyone in the hospital room stood frozen, watching the unfolding spectacle before their eyes.

Swoosh.

Jin Tae-gyeong, sitting cross-legged, began to float in the air. Slowly, without stopping.

Above his head, a flickering blue flame took the form of petals.

One, two, and as the final petal was about to complete, Jin Tae-gyeong's eyes opened wide.

Swish! Crunch!

Like a bird shot out of the sky, Jin Tae-gyeong's buttocks hit the ground. A dazed scream erupted.

"Ouch, damn it! My tailbone!"

The air in the hospital room froze in astonishment.

※ Oops.

I screamed as loudly as I could.

"Aaaah!"

It hurt. My tailbone hurt from hitting the ground, and the frustration of missing a golden opportunity multiplied by ten.

"It was almost there! It was almost done!"

Damn it. The pinnacle of perfection was just one step away, but it had slipped away into the distance.

I don't know if it was because of a lack of depth in my martial arts or if there was another reason.

Maybe it could be both. But what's important is that such an opportunity may not come again.

"Oh no!"

As I pounded the ground and wailed, my system notification penetrated deep into me.

Ding. Ding. Ding.

- [Unleashed Skill: Nullification] has been released!

- [Attack Power] has increased to 100 years!

- You have achieved an outstanding accomplishment! You have obtained the title [Master of Masters]!

- Unexpected Quest, [I Only Took Half of the Assimilated Power], has been successfully completed.

- Repeatable Quest, [Back, Back, Let's Look at Your Back!], has been successfully completed!

- You have acquired a tremendous amount of experience points!

- Level Up!

"Leave me alone, you damn system!"

Everything was perfect. I had absorbed nearly half of the energy in Team Leader Choe's battle aura, and my mind had momentarily plunged into the realm of nullification.

However...

“"Why! Why can't I be happy!"

I obtained an overwhelming power all of a sudden?
That's great!

Obtaining titles, completing quests, leveling up, everything is great. It's all great! But why!

"Why can't I reach the pinnacle!"

At that moment, the echoing words pierced through the air, digging into my ears.

"What's wrong with Jin Tae-gyeong?"

"I'm not sure, but I've heard that some people become invalids while practicing mana manipulation."

"No, more importantly, did everyone see the petals just now? Was it just me? Why is no one saying anything?"

"Did you see the flowers too? I thought I had come to a flower exhibition in Goyang City."

As I heard voices filled with concern and astonishment, my mind suddenly cleared.

That's right. It's not over yet. Even if that person becomes only half of Team Leader Choe, there is a possibility of progressing towards the pinnacle.

"I still have three experimental subjects."

With the spirit of Admiral Yi Sun-sin facing the imminent Battle of Myeongnyang, I opened my mouth.

"Immediately remove the restrictions. Proceed."

Ding.

- Repeatable Quest, [Back, Back, Let's Look at Your Back!], has been activated!

"Back, Back, Let's Look at Your Back!"

People stepped back with faces filled with awe and fear.
