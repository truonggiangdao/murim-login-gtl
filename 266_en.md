"Such cowardice."

A clear voice resonated and spread.

Compared to Cheongpung, who recalled the sunlight and blue sky of Mount Yeonhwa, Hyeolju felt a shocking sensation as if his heart sank.

He couldn't sense the presence of just over twenty people. It was none other than himself.

He narrowed his eyes as he saw a person walking up the trail.

"That guy..."
A slender physique and a pitiful appearance. He appeared to be in his mid-twenties at most.

With a haphazardly inserted sword in his sheath, the blade was stained with a deep red rust.

A dry voice flowed through Hyeolju's lips.

"Sangseung Sword?"

The young man, Jonglicheu, smiled.

"I was always worried.
A naive child who knows no fear, how big of a wave would he face in the martial arts world?"

"What nonsense is this..."

Hyeolju suddenly realized. From the beginning, all of Jonglicheu's words and actions were directed at one person only.

"But now, it's over. You really did defeat me well."

A warm gaze and voice.

A faint smile appeared on the corner of Cheongpung's lips, who was struggling with great difficulty.

Observing that sight, Hyeolju burst into laughter.

"Look at them...~"

This was not treating someone as insignificant. It was about him, who even within the Heavenly Secrets Clan was feared and respected by numerous individuals.

In response to the blatant disregard from these puppy-like guys, his grip involuntarily tightened.

Crack!

With the sound of bones dislocating, blood splattered from Cheongpung's lips.

As Cheongpung groaned in pain and lost consciousness, Jonglicheu's calm voice echoed in Hyeolju's ears.

"That's enough."

Seeing the disappeared smile on Jonglicheu's face, Hyeolju felt relieved.

Hyeolju chuckled and opened his mouth.

"Now I can see you clearly."

"I've been seeing you from the beginning. I kept chasing after your retreating back, but I lost sight of you."

Listening quietly, Hyeolju furrowed his brows.

"It was you? That fearless guy who hindered me."

"You were a step too late. It's a pity."

Jonglicheu calmly and confidently responded, causing Hyeolju to look him up and down.

"Sangseung Sword, Jonglicheu. So this guy is the one."

He had almost cut off the breath of the Great King's neck when that guy intervened. As the situation escalated rapidly, he had no choice but to turn around without finishing it.

"At that time, he had the momentum to surpass at least ten kings and even more."

No matter how powerful Hyeolju was, if his ankles were bound within the Heavenly Secrets Clan, he would inevitably suffer defeat. Even after nearly killing him and fleeing, that guy had pursued him further.

"I almost caught up with him."

Fortunately, the martial arts Hyeolju had mastered was far beyond the reach of common people, which allowed him to escape the imminent danger.

But now, Hyeolju looked at Jonglicheu with a suspicious gaze.

"So it was you, the unknown master?"

Jonglicheu absentmindedly smoothed his smooth beard.

"Unknown master... I did receive a few teachings."

"Are you his disciple?"

"Even to a suckling infant, there are things to learn. Everyone who passes by in life is both a teacher and a disciple to each other."

"Remove the nonsense and get rid of the obstacles of this misty mountain pass right away. Before I strangle his neck."



However, instead of a response, what returned was Jong Li Chu's calm gaze. His eyes were deep as if they could endlessly draw you in, yet serene like a still lake on a windless day.

"What is this feeling?"

It was strange. Just by locking eyes, I couldn't easily grip my sword tightly. On the contrary, it felt like my strength was slipping away. It was as if there was something invisible holding onto my wrist, refusing to let go.

"This is like... O2."

Suddenly, a thought followed, filling me with disgust.

No, that's impossible. How could I dare think of "that person" when faced with this wretched traitor?

"That's impossible. If I were to cut down such a scum, it would be over in an instant."

I forced myself to regain composure. However, within my heart, an indescribable sense of unease was growing.

Can I really defeat him? Can I escape from this situation?

Jong Li Chu licked his dry lips slowly.

"Who exactly are you?"

The information network of the hidden rivers and lakes is vast and yet limited. However, there is one person whose identity remains unknown: Jong Li Chu. His face, his origins, everything is impossible to guess. He tilted his head slightly.

"Is that important?"

"Of course."

"If a few words could make you stop, I would have answered. But you won't stop."

A calm voice continued.

"There are still people struggling with their own circumstances. If you don't want to stop yourself, then you have to be stopped."

Slurp.

Jong Li Chu finished speaking and drew a rusty sword from his waist. A worn-out blade appeared, and a sneer formed on my lips.

"You're going to stop me with that sword? It's hardly even a weapon."

"You're right. It's not much of a sword."

"But it's enough to deal with someone like you."

"Who was the last person you killed with that sword? Some insignificant bandit? Or perhaps a commoner?"

At that moment, a faint voice escaped between Jong Li Chu's lips.

"Cheon Dok Ma Gun (Poisonous Night Heron)."

My body stiffened.

Cheon Dok Ma Gun.

A nickname that no martial artist could be unaware of.

During the Great Martial Arts Tournament, the leader of the Heavenly Horse Sect, Cheon Ma, proclaimed himself as a god and swept across the world. He was the formidable leader of the Heavenly Horse Sect, and he was none other than Cheon Dok Ma Gun.

But even he couldn't escape the fate of a martial artist.

One day, he encountered a certain individual. On that day, Cheon Dok Ma Gun met his death, and the one who killed him acquired a new name.

"Geom Seong Mae Jong Hak (Geom Seong the Extinguisher)!"

My body trembled as if struck by lightning.

Geom Seong Mae Jong Hak.

That name briefly crossed my mind when I tried to guess Jong Li Chu's identity. But I immediately dismissed it.

It couldn't be. It shouldn't be possible.

I managed to squeeze out a voice that escaped my lips.

"You... How could you..."

Jong Li Chu, or rather Geom Seong Mae Jong Hak, stroked the rusty sword gently as he replied.

"After the Great Martial Arts Tournament ended, I suddenly had a thought. What should I do now? The pondering didn't last long. I simply loved martial arts."

Evil. Evil laughter.

Every time the young, greenish-blue cast iron touched his hand, the rusty sword turned red and revealed its transparent true form.

"You devoted yourself relentlessly to martial arts. My belated disciple, who occasionally became my master. That's how I thought I reached the peak, but another wall appeared."

Geom Seong Mae Jong Hak.

The great martial artist who had already reached a high level decades ago stepped into a new realm once again.

To him, who was already prepared in every aspect, a higher challenge had come knocking.

"I couldn't have anticipated the Half-Step Return to the Origin, or how difficult it would be to control my physical body. It made me curious about the outside world. I even thought about the brat who left a year ago, the one with great potential."

And so, Geom Seong Mae Jong Hak emerged into the world and traveled under the name Jong Li Chu.

He was already a figure from a distant past, and no one doubted the young man who had returned to the realm of mortals.

Even the Amcheon, the hidden sect, was not an exception to his far-reaching net.

"It was a pleasant time. Until you all appeared."

Evil laughter!

The last layer of corrosion covering the rusty sword peeled away.

Finally, it regained its original appearance, and the chilling blade emitted a cold light.

Hundreds, or perhaps thousands, of lives soaked the sword with their blood, and it now aimed at the source of that blood.

"Is this sword still usable, just as I said?"

In the next moment, a young, greenish-blue flash erupted.

Swish!

It was astonishing!

Slow-motion captured the image of Cheongpung, the Wind of Greenery, collapsing.

Someone's mature wrist gripped his already dazed neck.

"Jung Gun... (It's my hand.)

The thought that should have followed was drowned in a mixture of blood and pain. Unbeknownst to himself, a scream burst from his half-opened mouth.

"Kraak!"

But it wasn't over yet.

Along with the scream, a chilling voice followed the stumbling figure.

"Having accumulated an unpayable debt, don't you think it's time to pay the price?"

Shiiing!

Hair on the entire body of the fallen Cheongpung bristled.

It was like a hallucination. All scenery disappeared, and only a single sword aimed at his heart captured his entire being.

Strook!

A single sword glided through the air. The pale golden aura of Jaha Singong's supernatural qi spread in all directions like thirty-six plum blossoms in full bloom.

Hearing the beautiful sight, Cheongpung moaned like a wounded animal.

"Thirty-Six Plum Blossom Swords."

But it was different. Clearly different.

If Cheongpung's Plum Blossom Sixteen Swords were based on seasons, what Ma Jong Hak, now revealed as Geom Seong Mae Jong Hak, unleashed went beyond martial arts.

That power was digging into Cheongpung's meridians.

"I can't stop this."

As Cheongpung stared in astonishment, he hurriedly tried to dodge.

Thud!

Someone's grasp caught his ankle.

Jin Tae-gyeong, who thought he had already exerted all his strength and lost consciousness, revealed his blood-stained teeth as he laughed.

"Where do you think you're going, this seed?"

"Nyo..."

Thud!

He couldn't continue his words. Jong Li Chu's eyes were filled with a glimmer of a young, greenish-blue flash.

Blood splattered, flesh was torn. In an immense pain, his mind momentarily went blank.

"Geo Hyuk..."

It was on a different dimension. There was no way to block the onslaught of sword energy that closed the distance in a dozen steps.

Swish! Swish!

Then, in the fainting consciousness, Jin Tae-gyeong's eyes suddenly widened.

"No, if it's that... If it's that, I can survive."

The mission was already complete. The evidence was in his hand, the one remaining jade green orb.

Though he couldn't kill the Fire King... It was regrettable, but as long as he clung to his life, as long as he lived, he could look forward to the future.

With a poisonous gleam in his eyes, he stared at Jong Li Chu. Even as he vomited blood, he continued to laugh.

"Wait. I will definitely kill you with my own hands."

Evil laughter.

"Until then, stay alive. Definitely."

The corners of Jin Tae-gyeong's mouth curled upward.

Sensing something, Ma Jong Hak quickly unleashed his sword with a hardened determination.

"Can't stop it!"

Slash! Swish!

It was a moment when Jin Tae-gyeong's one remaining arm was severed, his eyeballs popping out.

"Heavenly Roar!"

Shiiing!

With a scream, he gathered his last bit of strength, and his divine form shot forward like lightning.

His firm teeth bit into his own severed arm, or rather, the remaining jade green orb.

And then...

Crack!

With an ominous black radiance that engulfed his entire body, he disappeared along with Jin Tae-gyeong as if they had never existed in the first place.
