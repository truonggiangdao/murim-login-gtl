With the scattered white truck, mingled with patches of blood-soaked beard, the middle-aged monk uttered a raspy voice.

"Ma... Ma-gui. You're a devil."

A calm voice pierced through his ears.

"Sakyamuni once overcame the temptation of devils and attained enlightenment under the Bodhi tree. However..."

Choi-aak!

A hand drenched in a chilling blue aura emerged from the monk's chest.

Bang! The wound was already frozen, and drops of blood turned into ice fragments as they fell on the ground.

"No enlightenment can continue in the face of death."

The monk shivered under the overwhelming chill that engulfed his entire body.

Whether it was due to the extreme Yin energy that froze even his internal organs or the imminent aura of death right before his eyes, he couldn't tell. No, he couldn't comprehend it.

Srrlok, thump.

As the monk breathed his last breath, the eyes of the old man, Yum-gwi Hansu, sunk deep into his sockets.

"It was dangerous. It exceeded my expectations."

He looked around. At the entrance of the collapsed cliff cave, there were the bodies of the fallen, including the just-fallen middle-aged monk, strewn about.

"Sadaegeumgang."

Each of them, renowned warriors even within Soryeomsa, possessed profound martial arts skills.

In particular, the last one, Baengjung, was a master who had reached the pinnacle of perfection. If they hadn't sacrificed flesh and taken his bones, he might have lost his life to Sadaegeumgang's deadly techniques.

"Disgusting bastards. Somehow, they managed to carry on their lineage. But that ends today."

Soryeomsa suffered significant losses during the previous Jingmadaejun, nearing the brink of destruction.

Although the damage was so severe that it couldn't be compared to the past when it was known as the best in the world, the power of Soryeomsa, which had continued for a thousand years, still remained.

"But that's only until today."

Everything is going according to plan. After the Lawful King, the demise of Sadaegeumgang, and the transfer of authority to Gyeongcheondo's Yeomho, all that's left is to accomplish the mission entrusted to him.

Blindfolded, the hundreds of assassins, deprived of all senses, will drench Sungsan in blood and ignite the secret techniques of Janggyeonggak before retreating.

If they lose even their core masters, Soryeomsa will undoubtedly collapse.

And above all, there was a mission that took precedence.

Why the Soryeom's sacred object was deemed so important, he couldn't speculate, but it had to be accomplished.

Isn't that why the absolute trust was given to 'him'? Wasn't that the reason why Chonju accompanied them?

"Gyeongdo will be handled by me, and Soryeom will be handled by you. If we can't find the Nokok Fire Jade, well... let's leave it to our imagination."

As Han-su recalled the last words, his face hardened.

There was no room for any mistakes. If he failed, he would pay the price dearly.

Gwaaah!

As Han-su brushed off his sleeves, the blocked entrance of the cliff cave was revealed.

Even the massive stone gate couldn't stop his footsteps.

Kugugung!

With a loud noise, the stone gate collapsed. Dust and gravel soared into the air, and through the haze, a pair of eyes shone brightly.

"Siju, why have you come?"

As the young monk, Mu-myung, stood up

 from his meditation mat and slowly rose to his feet, Han-su curled the corners of his mouth.

"Are you Gyeongdo's disciple?"

"If that's the case, what do you want?"

"I came to take something from you."

"I have nothing to give you, Siju."

"Then let me correct myself. I came to take it away from you."

"To someone tainted with the scent of blood, not even a grain of rice can be spared."

"You don't need to hesitate. I will take your life along with it."

"Amitabha."

Captain and Yeomju, along with the nameless warrior, glowed with determination.

"It won't be easy for you."

+6
Gwangcheon and Yeomho, two elite warriors at the pinnacle of their skills, engaged in a fierce battle.

Whack! Flash!
With every strike, swing, and kick, their movements carried tremendous power.

It was a fight between extraordinary beings who had stepped into the realm of perfection, where no one dared to intervene.

However, as time passed, the balance of victory began to shift.

Crash!

As Kanggi's two fists struck, blood dripped from someone's mouth.
The gray robes worn by the monks were stained with crimson.

Yeomho, who had retreated a few steps in the invisible wind, revealed a bitter smile.

"You were still sucking on your mother's breast when Nobu humiliated me. It's been barely thirty years."

Gwangcheon covered his mouth with his sleeve. Despite his pale complexion, the eyes of the old warrior were burning fiercely.

"Nogi (#16) is nowhere to be found. How about entering the main hall now?"

"Even the Jeongma warriors failed to capture Nobu. There's no need to mention a weakling like you."

The intensity of Yeomho's burning spirit grew stronger, and Gwangcheon bit his lip. He knew that Yeomho's words were not mere confidence but the undeniable truth.

'What kind of monster is he to fly so fiercely? It's impossible to imagine what awaits at the end.'

Gwangcheon's pupils moved ever so slightly. His gaze fell upon a group of more than a hundred undefeated warriors fighting against the masked villains.

Exactly 108 in number, they were the faces and pride of the Sollim Temple, the formidable Baekpalnahahn (6/\\※\※).

Carefully chosen and trained as the absolute best, they wielded their swords and staffs, pushing back the masked villains.

"Do not show mercy to these evildoers!"

"Open the Salmun (\\85)!"

The true power of Baekpalnahahn is revealed when they unleash the Baekpalnahahnjin. And they each performed their assigned roles with excellence, calmly executing their countless hours of training in real combat.

Clang! Swish!

Under the overwhelming force of the Baekpalnahahnjin, the masked villains fell one by one, spilling blood.

Despite the initial one-sided advantage, the battle had now turned into a deadlock.

"If we continue like this... it's possible."

The Muryeong Alliance is just a few hours away. If the reinforcements arrive, it will be the end for the Eumyangsanggwi and the masked villains.

That moment when hope flickered in Gwangcheon's eyes.

"Hahaha!"

"Look at your expression, revealing your thoughts. You seem like an innocent fool."

Gwangcheon's face hardened.

Did Yeomho already know it would come to this?

But why?

Before the questions could be answered, a deafening noise filled their ears, and the ground shook violently.

Boom!

Gwangcheon unknowingly opened his mouth, staring at the scene before him.

In the slowed-down world, blood poured like rain through the gaps between the stacked bodies, about ten stories high. And one axis of the vanished Baekpalnahahnjin, as if swallowed by a giant monster.

"No way!"

With Gwangcheon's cry, time returned to its normal flow.

Amidst the space reduced to rubble by the explosion, masked individuals surged like waves into the spot where the Baekpalnahahnjin, towering over twenty people, had been obliterated.

Suk, sukk, sukk!

The Na Hanseungs, who were nothing more than ordinary humans, froze in front of their assailants, their eyes filled with terror.

The flickering gleams of their swords filled the frozen battlefield, where there was no room for a moment's distraction. The price of hesitation was brutal.

"Kraaack!"

"Priest!"

The invincible shield-like Baekpalnahahnjin crumbled relentlessly. Some elderly monks tried to defend the formation belatedly, but it was all in vain.

They were not facing ordinary people; they were confronting beings akin to demons.

"The heavens have commanded. Kill the enemies."

Zunnnn!

Along with the relentless murmurs, a red light flowed from the masked figure's Seven Luminaries.

The Na Hanseungs, who had never witnessed such a knight (dance #), widened their eyes in disbelief.

"W-What is this?"

"It's magic! It's magic! Everyone, defend yourselves!"

But it was already too late.

The expanding red light, enveloping the entire body of the masked figure, exploded in all directions, entangling dozens of Na Hanseungs and a few masked individuals.

Crash!

Explosions. Roaring and screaming.

Someone's limb flew into the sky, and the falling raindrops were stained red.

In Gwangcheon's widened pupils, red blood vessels appeared.

"How dare they..."

The Sollim Temple, the fortress that had remained unchanged even during the Jeongma War, was overflowing with corpses and death.

The young disciples who exchanged greetings with smiles every morning had their lives cut short, and the priests who had built decades of friendship were nowhere to be found.

In the hellish scene unfolding before him, blood dripped from Gwangcheon's tightly clenched fist.

"This... this can't be, this can't be."

Yeomho chuckled upon hearing Gwangcheon's internal struggle.

"It's called 'Bloody Magic.' It's so difficult to master that it's almost impossible, but it's perfect for situations like this. I brought a couple of them... more than I thought."

"How dare you!"

With a cry that resembled a scream, Gwangcheon unleashed his divine power.

However, what awaited him was a fist enveloped in a crimson aura.
Perverberbyung!

The invincible aura shattered, and a powerful strike shook Gwangcheon's body.

Amidst the overwhelming pain and the splattering blood, pieces of organs were mixed in.

"Kueeeeeh!"

In Gwangcheon's blurry vision, Yeomho approached with leisurely steps.

"You foolish fool. How could you forget the Unwavering Mind after mastering the Suryeom's Martial Arts until that age?"

"Cough, cough!"

It was a blatant mistake. No matter what happened, he should never lose his composure. No matter what scene he witnessed, he should have calmly dealt with it.

The opponent was already a monster comparable to the Ten Kings during the Jeongma War.

The best course of action was to maintain a standoff and buy time.

"This...~ㄴ>
However, Gwangcheon struggled to rise to his feet, his breath ragged.

Not yet. If he fell, Sollim would fall too. He had to protect this place until his breath was cut off.

Even if just one person could survive.

That was the final mission of an old monk who had dedicated his life to Sollim.

"Ohgeora."

Yeomho frowned at Gwangcheon's burning gaze.

"This is why I dislike you mediocre beings. You act all high and mighty when you're about to die."

"What could a fool like you possibly understand?"

"Perhaps one thing."

Yeomho laughed maniacally.

"You're going to die now."

Shiiing!

Gwangcheon, already wounded, couldn't match the speed of Yeomho's approaching fist.

In an instant, Yeomho's fist struck Gwangcheon's shoulder.

Thud!

With a dull sound, the powerful aura in his fist cut through flesh and bone.

Gwangcheon, whose insides had been emptied, let out a scream.

~

"You damn wretched worm, how dare you dodge my punch? Let's see if you can dodge this."

Yeomho's foot pressed down on Gwangcheon's head, writhing in pain and injury.

With only a fraction of his strength, Yeomho's foot would crush his head like a watermelon.

"What should I say in this situation? Ah, yes."

Yeomho struck his forehead exaggeratedly.

"May you be reborn in the Land of Bliss."

Crack.

A slowly exerted force.

It was the moment when death rushed upon Gwangcheon.

"Remove that filthy foot of yours. Before I turn your wretched soul into ashes."

"I'll make it as crispy as a dried chili pepper."

Two voices, one oppressive and the other youthful and fresh.

The first voice belonged to the oppressor, and the other was like a tender blue sky.

As the sound reached his ears, Yeomho's face hardened.

"Hwawang...!"
