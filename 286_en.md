Title: Strange Dream, Can Anyone Interpret?

Early in the morning, a brief post appeared on a popular forum site frequently used by hunters.

Title: "Hey, guys, I had a weird dream. Can someone interpret it for me?"
I can't reveal the exact details, but let's just say I'm a member of a well-known guild's security team who deals with occasional troublemakers. But that's not important.
While I was working as usual, I dozed off for a moment, and in my dream, something bizarre happened.

There was this strange person who kept muttering something, so I went to apprehend him along with Sasu (I think his real name is Yamamoto, but he keeps it hidden). And that turned out to be the person from my dream.

But I can only remember up to this point. After that, Sasu winked at me, and it ended with me saying, "Iraimasu."

(869! Comment) Is there anyone here who can interpret this before we discuss it? I have no idea what this person is talking about.

ㄴ222
ㄴI can't grasp the context, especially the meaning of "Iraimasu."

ㄴWhy is Sasu referred to as a "traitor"? Is he a member of Yukinullo from Hittek?

ㄴ(Poster) They keep using Japanese words like "Iraimasu" because they're obsessed with the Kingdom. They use words like "yudori," "gensei," and many others.

ㄴYou said "Iraimasu."

ㄴ(Poster) Yes.

ㄴThat person is crazy. Yeah, he's just crazy.

ㄴ(Poster) But when I told Sasu about the dream, he said he had a similar one. Seeboljwa was fighting with our guild members, including Ares' vice guild master.

ㄴThe poster wants to beat Seeboljwa.

ㄴ(Poster) It's true! And then he told me his phone went missing and blamed me. It was the latest model, so I gave him a hard time.

ㄴHello, I'm a current fortune teller. I sense something unusual from your post. Could you please provide more details?

ㄴ(Poster) Huh, are you really a fortune teller?

ㄴNo, I'm just pretending.

ㄴ(Poster) Ah, I see. Are you a crazy person?

The post was deleted in less than 10 minutes.

The people who saw the post didn't pay much attention to the disappearance of an eccentric individual, and nobody suspected the involvement of the Ares guild throughout the whole process.

Except for me, of course.

"They must have manipulated memories using psychic magic."

It's a clear violation, but it's amusing how those who train black hunters don't care about it.

Among the comments, there was mention of someone losing their high-end phone, which implies that they meticulously checked every phone.

That was a decisive piece of evidence.

My dedicated cameraman abruptly retreated when Park Tae-seop and Park Ji-hoon appeared, leaving me alone to fall into the depths of the Ares guild's trap.

Well, I wasn't too disappointed. I had already been searched thoroughly when I left the building. After checking my shared cloud folder, they returned it to me, accompanied by a subtle warning.

"If you're hiding anything, delete it now. It won't be fun if you get caught later."

Although it wasn't an appropriate time, I couldn't help but feel impatient because I

 had adult videos on my phone that could get me in trouble. The way the person spoke was not at the level of an ordinary person.

If it weren't for the current situation, I would have given him a good beating.

"I'll remember your face clearly. You birdbrain-looking bastard."

He had a square face with a sporty haircut. From handling the aftermath and witnessing others calling him "team leader," I figured he must be around the rank of Ijeongryong, one of Lee Jeong-ryong's right-hand men.

I confirmed his name as Seoggojun through [Gigam]. To be honest, the reason I found out his name was due to his skills.

"That bastard seems to have learned some martial arts-like techniques."

Once I had a suspicious thought, I could see things more clearly than before.

The Ares guild members left behind by Lee Jeong-ryong were not ordinary individuals. Even individually, they were skilled hunters who could easily handle B-rank hunters.

Among them, the impression I got from Seoggojun... to be honest, it surprised me deeply.

His cocky manner of speaking stemmed from the confidence that comes from his skills.

"How did they raise such people?"

Could it be real martial arts? Or perhaps it's a unique combat technique developed within the Ares guild. Various questions kept popping up in my mind.

Just when I was deeply lost in thought, it happened.

"Excuse me, Mr. Lee. Patient Im Hyuk-jun has regained consciousness!"

The nurse's cry from outside the door in the hallway made me jump up.

Im Hyuk-jun. That's almost never mentioned in Im Jeong's public records. He regained consciousness after three long days.

※

"Hey, everyone! Dad's awake!"

- "Goodbye, Dad!"

I suppressed the urge to burst open the door of the hospital room and held back. Now is the time for the family.

The sound of crying from my wife and children, who hadn't seen their father for three days, seeped through the gap in the door.

After a wave of sobbing subsided, it was our turn.

"Oh, everyone's here?"

젠장. From the first word, my throat feels tight.

Im Jeong-ryong opened his arms with a bright smile but ended up sneezing.

~
"Be careful with your arms! Careful!"

"I thought I'd be fine, but it's a bit sore when I move."

"I magically attached his dislocated arm, and he immediately felt better. Is he a human or a transforming robot?"

Song Song-i gave a sarcastic remark and recited a healing spell. Im Jeong-ryong's complexion visibly relaxed.

"Thank you, Song Yang."

"If you're thankful, please be careful. Didn't the healer tell you not to overexert yourself and take at least two weeks of rest?"

"You're being too demanding."

"Oh, sir!"

"Oh my, my ears are going to fall off."

I didn't expect to feel so delighted seeing that smiling face.

Im Jeong-ryong, who burst into a cheerful laugh like a bandit, turned his head to the others.

"Kim Hyung, no, Guild Master. Thank you very much. I heard from the kids' mom that you took good care of me while I was unconscious."

Kim Jipsa nodded modestly.

"You don't need to thank me. It was only natural. When a fellow guild member goes through something like this, we should all step up."

"I heard that you also spent a lot of money on the treatment."

Im Jeong-ryong's treatment involved hiring a famous healer and generously pouring in expensive high-grade potions.

It had been the same before, but it's a world where even a person's life has a price. Who would do this for a low-level Hunter like me, who only has a reputation?

Kim Jipsa chuckled softly at Im Jeong-ryong's moist voice.

"If you really feel the need to thank someone, thank Jeonju (32). As for me, a face reader, I'll excuse myself."

Im Jeong-ryong's gaze shifted towards Jeonju.

His voice seemed to have a touch of heat, like a hot pot. Before Choi Team Leader could say anything, he quickly cut in.

"It's not Im Jeong-ryong's fault. It's our guild's fault for exposing him to danger. It was my mistake and negligence for not preventing such a tragedy. If anyone should feel sorry, it's me."

"Choi Team Leader!"

Tears welled up in Im Jeong-ryong's eyes, making him look like a model prisoner.

When he tried to hug him, Choi Team Leader recoiled in surprise.

"Be, be careful with your arms."

"This much is fine. I just wanted to give you a hug."

"Well, I'd rather pass on such an honorable opportunity to the last person."

It didn't seem like such a glorious opportunity, but anyway, it was finally my turn.

For a moment, silence descended.

If Im Jeong-ryong woke up, there was something I really wanted to say, but when I finally faced him, my mouth sealed shut.

It was Im Jeong-ryong who broke the silence first.

"How is it?"

"Ye... Yes."

"Our wife and kids. Aren't they lovely?"

Unintentionally, I stifled a laugh at his endless family boasting.

"Yes. They are."

"Your sister-in-law should be a beauty."

"I agree. By any chance, were you kidnapped or threatened?"

"There's no tree that falls down after being hit ten times. Remember that. I succeeded on the seventeenth try."

"Just now, you said there's no tree that falls down after being hit ten times."

Im Jeong-ryong laughed heartily.

"Well, there actually is. But

 hitting a tree ten times won't do much."

"It seems you haven't been formally charged."

"My child, if I had given up back then, would I have gained such a beauty?"

Her face swollen, Lim Jeong's wife covered her face and waved her hands. The children, still in elementary school, looked at me with curious eyes, as if asking when I had cried.

"Daddy, who is it?"

"Who is it? Who is it!"

Jeong Jung-jeong hugged the clinging children and answered.

"It's Uncle. It's Tae-kyung's uncle."

"Tae-kyung's uncle?"

"Yeah, remember when Daddy told you? He has a handsome and strong uncle."

I had told the family about my story. Warmth spread from the depths of my heart. The pupils of the children's eyes looking at me became even brighter.

These siblings could be child actors. This is the victory of maternal genes.

"Wow! The man is Tae-kyung's uncle?"

"Nice to meet you!"

A genuine laugh spontaneously erupted. I patted the heads of the two children and said to Jeong Jeong.

"The kids are cute. Innocent and lovely."

"That's what I'm saying. You should get married and have a daughter too. Then you'll understand why people call you a daughter fool."

I was called a daughter fool when I was in high school. Of course, I didn't have a daughter.

Watching this harmonious family, my heart became sentimental.

Jeong Jeong-jeong weakly raised his arms and hugged me. His hands, which had become noticeably weaker than before, gently patted my back.

Thump. Thump.

"Thank you. I'm always grateful."

The moment I heard those words, I made a firm decision that I had been carrying in my heart.

"I can't make the same mistake again."

I hugged Jeong tightly in my heart while mentally making a firm determination.

Today was the day a man returned to his family and friends.

One hour later, only five members of the Peace Guild, including me and Jeong Jeong-jeong, remained in the hospital room.

Jeong Jeong's wife hoped that her husband would rest, but Jeong Jeong-jeong was determined.

"I left my beloved wife and children behind. I have to go now. Tell me everything that happened, without leaving anything out."

Jeong Jeong, who had always been weak and cheerful, gained a firm determination and a strong mind.

Finally, when Jeong Jeong-jeong heard all the stories, his face stiffened.

"It was the Ares Guild?"

"Yes."

"And the Jeongryong you mentioned, is he really the same Jeongryong?"

"I'm sure."

A sigh-like groan escaped.

When the Black Hunter tail was revealed, the Myeongdong Guild appeared, and when the Myeongdong Guild body was revealed, the head of the Ares Guild appeared.

The problem was that the head was not an ordinary head.

"I followed the snake tail and a dragon head appeared."

Saying that, he looked at Chief Choi and Butler Kim with a sad expression. Both of them had calm expressions that were no different from usual.

But I clearly witnessed it.

Before Jeong Jeong-jeong regained consciousness, when he first mentioned the name Ares Guild, turmoil appeared in the eyes of the two.

"There is definitely something... I don't know the exact reason for the strangeness. I felt it and Song Song kept probing persistently, but after Jeong woke up, he briefly said he would tell us later and sealed his lips."

"But now is the time to speak up."

Was it because of our gaze? It was the moment when Chief Choi was about to speak.

Thump. Thump.

Various noises mingled in the hospital corridor. But their footsteps were different.

They were unusually heavy and resonant

.

And there was a presence.

"Come in."

People slowly stood up from their seats at my words.

Sure enough, the footsteps stopped in front of our hospital room.

Knock. With the sound of a knock, the door opened. The face I had seen just a day ago was there.

"Seok Go-jun?"

Wait. The fact that he came here was surprising.

I couldn't continue my thoughts. Seok Go-jun's face disappeared, and someone stepped forward into the hospital room.

Despite being in his seventies, he looked like he was in his forties with a youthful appearance. The charisma of a leader and a natural sense of oppression.

"Lee Jeong-tong,"

As his gaze passed us, he suddenly stopped in front of one person. His mouth twitched sadly, as if comforting.

"You have grown up a lot."

Chief Choi's gaze, looking at Lee Jeong-ryong, sank deeply.
