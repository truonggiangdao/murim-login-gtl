You seem innocent, like a naive person.

The words I heard the day before are still lingering in my mind. Sitting on the caregiver's chair next to the bed, I absentmindedly watch the mist spray on the chest tube. Suddenly, a thought pops into my head.

"No, it's not innocence."

The world of the martial arts is a place where the saying "seeing blood is common, and death is an everyday occurrence" fits. Power is justice, and the survivor is the winner. Every time I witness the brutality of the martial arts, I think of the modern world.

With its systematic welfare and laws, a civilization far superior to the martial arts has been achieved. But I was wrong.

"It's not innocence, it was stupidity."

While martial artists wear swords on their waists, modern people hide daggers up their sleeves. Monsters exist not only within the gates but also outside.

People who rule the concrete jungle with fine clothes and a righteous image. Those who begin to reveal the hidden daggers up their sleeves are the monsters outside the gate.

"Like Won Myung-hoon."

I've been thinking too naively all this time. I know the world is unfair and cruel, yet I couldn't let go of my complacency.

Because this is the modern era, the 21st-century democratic society. I thought that there wouldn't be incidents like today, even if there are fierce competitions to prove one's abilities.

"And this is the result."

I gaze at the sleeping Lim Jae-jeong. His severed forearms below the elbows have been healed with advanced healing magic and high-level potions.

It won't be much of a problem in everyday life... But returning as a hunter is uncertain. Magic is not omnipotent, after all.

"What kind of person is it?"

Various thoughts swim in my chilled mind.

Who, why, and for what purpose were the Black Hunters sent?

Cutting off Eok-jeong's arm may be a warning to stop around this point or a signal for the beginning.

"I'll soon find out the meaning of it."

I have no intention of waiting until then.

Neither do I, nor Team Leader Choi.

"Rest well, sir."

At that moment, when I covered the messy blanket over Lim Jae-jeong.

Uh. Uh.

With a vibration, the smartphone shines brightly in the darkness.

A short text message. The sender is Team Leader Choi.

"To the Guild House."

※* ※ ※
As soon as I checked the message, I left the hospital.

In the deep dawn, at the Guild House where everyone had gone home, two people were waiting for me.

"Ah, Jin Tae-kyung."

"Welcome."

Team Leader Choi and Song-song.

Kim Jipsa, who I thought would naturally be there, was nowhere to be seen.

Team Leader Choi, who noticed my gaze, spoke first.

"He briefly left his seat."

"Is that so?"

The fact that Kim Jipsa, who always stood by Team Leader Choi like a shadow, was absent was unexpected, but it didn't matter now.

Without further ado, I got straight to the point.

"What's the matter?"

"Before I say anything, would you like a cup of coffee? Well, let's start with this."

Instead of a coffee cup, Team Leader Choi handed me his smartphone. The screen displayed the homepage of the largest portal site in Korea.

As I tapped on the internet article with my finger, various news articles appeared under each category.

Among them, I quickly skimmed through the article at the top.

[The Judiciary Bowing Down to Public Fame. Where is the Fairness?]

[Integrated Party's Chief Member, Representative Yoon Seo-yoon: "The death was caused by an individual's reckless behavior. Won Myung-hoon should have faced legal judgment," strong criticism...]

[Self-defense or Murder?]

It was a political and social article, clearly pointing to someone even though the name wasn't mentioned.

"When was this posted?"

"An hour ago. But it already has over 100,000 views and more than 5,000 comments."

"If it was posted an hour ago, it must have been around 4 a.m."

"Seems like it. Netizens are quite diligent, or should I say, even the part-time workers."

"How interesting."

Team Leader Choi, who took a sip of his coffee that had cooled down as much as my frozen smile, spoke up.

"You know, there's another interesting article."

"More here?"

"Scroll down a bit. It must be more than what Tae-kyung saw."

Team Leader Choi's words were true. Without realizing it, my scrolling finger abruptly stopped.

I silently stared at the heavily emphasized article title.

[Exclusive Interview with Former Colleague *: "The Famous Hunter is a Despicable Human Being"]

As I touched the article, a three-minute preview of the interview video played. After a 15-second brand cosmetics advertisement, the screen was filled with a middle-aged man in a rumpled suit.

Although there was a slight mosaic on his face, I could easily recognize him.

~
Middle-aged, or rather, 'Former Colleague &'
I couldn't help but burst into laughter as I discovered his true identity.

His face was so familiar. The person I thought I would never see again was right there.

"I never expected to see him again like this."

Song Song, who was looking at his smartphone alongside me, asked, "Do you really know that person?"

"I do. It's hard not to know him."

"If he's doing an interview like this, it's obvious that there's some relationship between you two, right?"

"No."

"Then were you close?"

"It's not that..."

How should I express the relationship between that person and me? I pondered for a moment and then spoke up.

"It was like a candle."

1
No matter how much I think about it, that word suits perfectly.

Our relationship was that bad. Considering the things that had happened so far, it was surprisingly fortunate that no swords had been drawn.

I looked at Lim Cheong-jeong, lying on the bed, his shoulder wounded and covered with mist.

While I was away, I noticed that I gained some weight on my face.

"Hey, Sang-sik! Long time no see."

Kim Sang-sik, the team leader of the Picnic Guild.

Back when I was a Gold Hunter, it was Ba-rog who fired me as the guild leader.

The last time I saw him was when I visited the association for a reevaluation... I never expected to see him again like this.

"I heard you got kicked out of the guild after that."

Kim Sang-sik, a person lacking in skill but filled with greed. Despite his name, he lacked common sense and did all sorts of foolish things before getting kicked out.

He was known as a small-minded person, so it was obvious he would hold a grudge against me.

So, he even went as far as doing this interview.

"Let's hear what nonsense he's spouting."

Coincidentally, the video was starting with the journalist's question.

"I've heard that you have something to say about the recently famous Hunter X. Firstly, is it true that you were his former coworker?"

Kim Sang-sik nodded solemnly, a serious expression on his face.

"It's undoubtedly true. I was... I mean, I was his direct supervisor."

"More precisely?"

"He was my team member. After the gate incident two years ago, I became the team leader. And yes, I informed X about his dismissal this summer."

"Oh, I see. Were there any reasons for that?"

"It wasn't just one or two reasons."

After that, Kim Sang-sik passionately explained the reasons for firing me.

Each word he said was like a gem, but the final question and answer with the journalist was like the climax of a drama.

"I was expelled from the guild, where I had been falsely accused of corruption for over 20 years. But firing X wasn't for personal gain."

"Are you saying there were other reasons?"

"Yes."

He had a reason for releasing a mere three-minute teaser video. Kim Sang-sik adorned the grand finale with a powerful expression.

"Two years ago, during the incident with the mutated gate, he sacrificed his team members as prey for the monsters and escaped. He wouldn't hesitate to do any despicable and dirty things to survive..."

I couldn't even hear the rest of his words.

Even after the video ended with the subtitle saying that the full interview would be released soon, I continued to stare silently for a long time.

As if Kim Sang-sik would jump out of the screen.

Breaking the heavy silence, Team Leader Choi's words shattered the air.

"What did you think?"

Ah, what did I think?

My head was spinning, part of me wanted to laugh, and my stomach was churning with mixed emotions.

"It was quite entertaining, just like you said, Team Leader."

"I laughed the first time I saw it too. You know what kind of person #, I mean, Kim Sang-sik, is. The problem is..."

"The general public might not find it very interesting."

"That's exactly it."

The comment section was already on the verge of exploding.

With over 10,000 comments, there was no way I could read them all. The best comment with the most likes caught my eye.

(865 comments) I knew this would happen. I heard it through the grapevine and couldn't believe it. It was bound to explode someday.

What's that bridge they're talking about, and what's going to explode? I don't know who's behind this, but it's a relief that they're not in front of me.

If there had been, at the very least, the next piece of gossip should have been heard from the other side of the Hell's Bridge.

"Well, this is something. Doesn't seem like there's any need to watch further."

With a smile, I closed the comment window.

Team Leader Choi, who received my phone, leaned back and spoke casually.

"It's systematic. It's become clear that they aimed for us from the beginning by sending the Black Hunter."

"They're also creating a scapegoat with public criticism."

"That's how humans are. Once they start attacking properly, it's not easy to regain control."

"Meanwhile, I bet that the incident with the old man didn't make it to the news."

"You know it well."

"You'd be an idiot if you didn't. Wasn't there any word from the investigation team assigned to the case?"

Team Leader Choi slightly nodded his head.

"Could it be that they're all in on it?"

"It seems like there's external pressure as well. They have access to the 0017 data."

"Weren't there eyewitnesses?"

"All three of them have cut off contact."

That's just perfect.

Unbeknownst to me, a bone-crushing sound echoed from my clenched fist.

"This is getting too deliberate."

"It seems like their intention is to thoroughly isolate us. Like the interview video with Kim Sang-sik."

It wasn't some third-rate news outlet selling rumors or an interview with them.

It was a major media outlet that falls within the top ten in the country.

They will neatly package nonsensical and ambiguous claims, enhancing credibility with money and power along the way.

For example... testimonies from people who know me well.

"It's been a while since I've seen the faces of old colleagues. Ah, they'll be obscured by mosaic, so it'll be hard to recognize them, right?"

I asked, looking at Team Leader Choi with an unfamiliar gaze.

"Why do you say that?"

"I remember Mr. Jin Taekyung had a good reputation within the Picnic Guild."

"We were close with everyone. It was such a small guild after all."

"But why did you think that way?"

"It seems like this, this here, is what sells well."

I wiggled my thumb and forefinger together.

In the end, it's all about money. If they're hunters who risk their lives to make money, the temptation will be even stronger.

"After being hit on the back of the head repeatedly, it's hard to believe in people who've been living happily for the past seven years... Trust is no longer there."

A few days ago, I might have naively trusted my old colleagues.

But not anymore. Dreams, friendship, and common sense, the world where they coexisted has disappeared from my mind.

"Stop right there. I think they've already smeared mud on the face of a well-known member of the National Assembly. Can't we roast a few low-level hunters to make a living?"

"Obviously. I'll become the most hated person in the world and get bashed on the internet. Our guild's reputation will also take a hit."

Team Leader Choi, who had been wearing a strange expression all along, let out a chuckle.

"You've improved a bit. You can think like a seasoned adult."

"Are you retracting what you said about me being naive yesterday?"

"I'll decide that based on what you do from now on."

"What?"

"We can't afford to keep our eyes closed and be taken advantage of."

As he spoke, his finger pressed the smartphone screen. With the sound of the call connecting, someone answered the phone.

- I found it. The tail.

Through the speaker, Kim Jibsa's low and gentle voice flowed out.
