"Hospital? So suddenly?"

Just as I was about to ask what was going on, the call ended abruptly with urgent footsteps.

I tried calling again two or three times, but it was useless.

"The call cannot be connected. After the beep, it will be transferred to the voicemail..."
I ended the call after hearing the repetitive message. A sense of unease slowly emerged from the corner of my heart.

This is the first time. Team Leader Choi, who was always calm, showed such urgency.

"Could it be...?"

No, let's not jump to conclusions so quickly.

Now is not the time to think, but to act.

"Ilsan Hospital. He said Ilsan Hospital."

I grabbed my belongings and hurriedly left the dressing room. The rookies who were waiting outside turned their heads towards me.

Kim Jinsu, who was happily chatting in the center, suddenly stood up from his seat.

"Oh, senior. Are we leaving right now?"

"No, something urgent has come up."

It worked out well. There are two hours until the next raid. Fortunately, the gate is nearby, so the distance won't be too far.

"Kim Jinsu."

Thump.
"For the next two hours, Kim Jinsu will be the temporary team leader."

"What??"

"Take the tired ones and move to the next gate. Do not start the raid until I arrive."

I tapped Kim Jinsu's shoulder, who nodded with a confused face, and left the building.

I got into a taxi that was waiting for customers and told the destination, then immediately started making a phone call.

"Please pick up, please."

Ring, ring. Ring, ring.

As the dial tone prolonged, my restlessness grew.

Just when the signal got longer and I was about to hang up and call again.
Dalgak.

"Uh, son."

"What's up, oppa?"

"Shh. Stop playing with your phone while eating."

"Geez, is what mom's holding a brick, not a phone?"

"You brat!"

~
Thank goodness. It wasn't them.

I relaxed as I listened to the voices of the family coming through the receiver.

I quickly brushed off my mother's inquiry about what happened and hung up the phone.

"So, it must be a guild issue."

Who could have encountered trouble if Team Leader Choi isn't answering the phone? The person who would have the most accurate understanding of the situation would be Kim Jibsa.

But suddenly, someone's face flashed in front of me. Their diminished words and heavy expression.

"Worried, old man."

My prediction was correct.

The ringing tone that awaited me when I dialed the saved number was not the worried voice of Im Geokjeong but a cold mechanical sound.
"The power is off, beep sound..."

Arriving at the hospital in a hurry, I saw Song Song-i waiting for me with an anxious face.

"You're here?"

"Tell me on the way."

As we passed through the revolving door, the distinct smell of the hospital tickled my nose.

From civilians to hunters to hospital staff, I walked through the bustling crowd of people.

Some people recognized my face and took out their phones to take pictures.

"Hey, look over there."

"It's Jintae-gyeong."

"Jintae-gyeong? Damn, seriously?"

"Wow, the real deal."

I suppressed the urge to curse and clenched my teeth to endure the stress.

Passing through the crowd like a sea of people, I whispered to Song Song-i.

"What happened?"

"I don't know the details myself..."

"Just tell me what you know."

She bit her lip.

"It seemed like he had a lot on his mind lately."

"A lot on his mind?"

"The situation is tough. The guild is growing day by day, and even capable and young rookies are joining..."

"Alright, I get it. I know what it is."

Eukjeong was one of the original members of the Peace Guild since its early days and also the only Grade 17 hunter among us.

As the Peace Guild gained attention from the media, rumors and gossip related to it started to circulate.

They said he was the only flaw in the Peace Guild, telling him not to bother thinking about quitting and taking the bus for no reason.

Im Geokjeong was the one who laughed at us while holding us back.

But...

Did I keep my promise to take care of my people? The thought that I couldn't pay enough attention to the people close to me weighed on my chest.

"So, what happened after the raid yesterday?"

"I heard they got into a fight while drinking alone."

"Drunk fights, huh?"

"I heard they were pretty badly injured."

My heart sank in an instant.

Even if people who don't know him make disrespectful remarks about a Grade 17 hunter, Im Geokjeong has a 20-year career behind him.

Even if ten ordinary people attacked him, they wouldn't be able to defeat him.

"So, the opponents were hunters."

Song Song-i nodded silently.

"How badly is he hurt? Is it serious?"

"The treatment is over for now, but..."

Song Song-i's footsteps halted, unable to continue her words.

Above her head, the words "Special Treatment Ward" were written and trembled.

It was where healers, commonly known as "healers," treated patients. It also meant that the injuries were severe.

"I guess it's better to see it for myself."

With a sigh-like mumble, Song Song opened the door to the hospital room.

Creak.

Along with the strong smell of medicine, I saw three people pacing around the bed.

There was Team Leader Choi and Housekeeper Kim, as well as a middle-aged woman who I assumed was Im Geokjeong's wife.

Feeling my heart race, I approached the bed and said, "Sir?"

Instead of a response, I heard a faint sound of breath. Im Geokjeong, wearing an oxygen mask, was lying on the bed with white sheets.

It was his arm, the same one that used to embrace me tightly, but now I saw that it had been amputated just below the elbow.

※ ※ ※

There was a long silence in the room.

After I left the hospital room and went up to the rooftop, I still couldn't find the right words to say.

I listened quietly to the details of the incident shared by Team Leader Choi and Housekeeper Kim.

Finally, I mustered the courage to speak and asked, "Where are those guys now?"

Everyone in the room knew exactly who I was referring to.

Team Leader Choi, who was pursing his lips, silently nodded his head.

"Did you catch them?"

"No. All three of them escaped from the scene."

"What about their faces? Since they were at the bar, there must have been photos taken."

"The investigative agency has already looked into it. They couldn't identify them, and the results are out."

These days, 0017/ was like a camera. If their faces were properly captured, it was only a matter of time before they were caught. It was relatively easy to apprehend hunters and awakeners since there weren't many of them.

"Then it's over, right? Let's catch those bastards."

"They are unidentified. According to eyewitnesses, the suspects are Koreans, not awakeners or hunters."

"Are they Korean-Chinese or Korean-Japanese, perhaps?"

"No, they are not. According to the witnesses' testimonies, the suspects were Korean. They were the ones who started the altercation."

"What on earth...?"

I couldn't believe what I had just heard. Looking bewildered, I waited for an explanation from Team Leader Choi.

"They are unidentified. They said they have no records in the country."

"Therefore, it's possible that they are unregistered awakeners," Housekeeper Kim spoke up, breaking her silence.

"Black hunters (8130: 02660) could be a possibility."

Black hunters? The term itself felt dirty. Kim spoke in a hushed voice.

"Not all awakeners are registered with the regulatory agency or association."

I had never heard this term before, so I wondered if it referred to unregistered individuals.

I felt a throbbing sensation in my temple.

"You mean they are just unregistered?"

In modern society, awakeners were both a formidable shield and a delicate weapon. Even if they were low-ranking hunters, they possessed extraordinary abilities surpassing average humans.

That's why awakeners were always under strict management.

Even if they had no intention of becoming hunters, their names would still be included in the list of awakeners. They would only be excluded from the list after their death.

Unregistered awakeners were simply those who had not registered with the association within a specified period.

Ah, sometimes they were called by different names.

"Crazy bastards.

There were reasons behind the treatment of unregistered individuals as crazy bastards.

If they didn't voluntarily report within a month after awakening, they would be treated as detainees, not awakeners.

No probation, no leniency; they would be thrown into awakened prisoner correctional facilities without evidence, and upon release, they would receive an electronic ankle monitor as a souvenir.
So, do they have the audacity to risk their lives like that?

"Do such insane people still exist these days?"

"They have always existed, and they still do.
So, wouldn't crimes continue to occur without end?"

"So, those guys who attacked Geokjeong are unregistered individuals. How do we find them then?"

Housekeeper Kim interrupted softly.

"Black hunters."

"Yes, that means unregistered individuals."

"That's correct."

Kim gently stroked her well-groomed beard and continued speaking.

"Hunter Jintaekyeong, what do you think is the biggest difference between awakeners and hunters?"

An unexpected question. It felt like going around in circles. If it wasn't Kim, I might have said something in response.

Suppressing my boiling emotions, I answered.

"Training. Just having a gun doesn't make one a hunter."

"Unregistered individuals and black hunters fall into the same context."

"So, what you're saying is..."

Kim nodded her head.

"That's right. Unregistered individuals who have received systematic training like hunters. That's what black hunters are."

I was momentarily stunned. It's actually a very simple concept, but I had never thought about it before.

No wonder.

"How is that possible?"

Unregistered individuals are criminals. Where do they get weapons, and who provides them with systematic training?

"Could it be from criminal organizations or something, raising black hunters?"

"It's partly right and partly wrong to say it's a criminal organization."

"Really?"

In the next moment, Team Leader Choi made a brief bold statement.

"Where there are people, there is money.
When money accumulates, conflicts are inevitable.
Do you think Taekyeong thinks that the current guild exists purely to protect the world from monsters inside the gates?"

I couldn't make a bold statement.

Even I became a hunter not just to protect the world.

The intense turbulence of the past is already gone. People no longer associate hunters with a sense of noble duty or self-sacrifice.

They envy their wealth and fame. Those who grew up watching that become hunters.

The collection of these hunters is called a guild.

"Do you know the ranking of domestic conglomerates? From the first to the tenth. On the surface, they may all be private companies, but in reality, they are no different from the top echelons of powerful guilds. The same applies to overseas."

Team Leader Choi let out a cold laugh.

Finally, escaping from the shock, I opened my mouth.

"Is all of that, is it all true?"

"You asked me that question before.
Why did I leave the Ares Guild?"

Although Team Leader Choi didn't continue speaking, it was enough for me to understand his meaning.

They're all just a bunch of shit in the same toilet.
To them, black hunters are like hidden daggers up their sleeves. No one knows of their existence.

Or rather, they can pretend not to know.

Amidst the chilling realization, an unresolved question came to mind.

"Fine. Let's say everything you've said is true."

Taking a deep breath, my mind grew cold.

"But why did those black hunters specifically target Mr. Jeong?
To go to such lengths to restrain us, who are far below them..."

"Taekyeong."

Team Leader Choi interrupted my words and pursed his dry lips.

His gaze was piercing, as if looking at a rookie.

It felt like going back to the day I had just become a hunter.

"You're so innocent."

Before I could retort, he continued speaking.

"This is a place where monsters roam. It's a place where we can erase a bothersome human or even a guild. Discard your naive common sense."
