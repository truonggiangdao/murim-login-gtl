"He was just an ordinary middle-aged man, the kind you can find anywhere in the neighborhood. A faint trace of bluish beard extended from his ears to his chin. His practical hiking outfit clung loosely to his protruding belly.

In the early morning, with sleepy eyes, he finished his stretching routine and started jogging along the quiet path. His typical grunting sound accompanied his movements.

Kim Jibsa had found the 'tail,' as he claimed.

"Is this the guy?"

Inside a van that could be seen anywhere, Song Song-i watched a video recorded by Kim Jibsa with a skeptical expression.

"He looks pretty ordinary."

"Maybe looking extraordinary is no longer necessary. He doesn't give off the vibe of a Black Hunter or a Grade 9 civil servant."

"Well, even so, he seems too ordinary. Is there something that only combat hunters would recognize?"

Seba, I stared intently as the middle-aged man returned to his mansion after finishing his jog.

What I was seeing was just a simple video, so I couldn't feel his power. However, no matter how talented an actor is, they tend to reveal themselves in the tiniest of movements.

And I had the ability to see through the acting.

"A peak expert?"

I wasn't the only one who reacted to my mutter.

Both Team Leader Choi and Kim Jibsa looked at me as if asking what I meant.

"I mean, he's a Grade 4 Hunter."

"What did you say? Did you say a peak expert?"

"That's not what I said. You must have misheard."

In these situations, a firm denial is the answer. Why would I admit to something the person didn't do?

The perplexed expressions on their faces quickly disappeared, and both Team Leader Choi and Kim Jibsa nodded in agreement, seemingly aligning with my opinion.

"I agree that he's a Grade & Hunter."

"From what I observed, he seems to be quite skilled, even among Grade 2 hunters. He seemed to have noticed the surveillance magic, so we had to keep our distance."

Kim Jibsa had been a hero in a dramatic turnaround battle, and since he had personally witnessed it, it made sense for him to think that way. However, Team Leader Choi seemed to have a much sharper eye than I had anticipated.

This is not something just anyone could recognize.

"Well, anyway, that's not important right now." I asked the question that I was most curious about. "But how did you find him? I heard that the Investigation Team had confiscated everything in Area 0017."

"I found Na-si."

No, I mean, how did you find him? Before I could ask, Team Leader Choi pressed his thumb and index finger together, forming a circle.

"Tae-kyung mentioned it. He said this method always works."

He must have bribed someone in the Investigation Team.

Considering Team Leader Choi's distribution, although I didn't know who it was, someone must have been well taken care of.

"But didn't you mention external pressure?"

"When there's external pressure, all you need to do is offer enough money to withstand it."

That's quite impressive.

But as I listened to his words, it seemed that there were limits even to money.

"He seems to be quite a formidable opponent. I tried everything, but he wouldn't speak even if I showered him with money. Area 017 was our best shot."

"Is he the one caught there?"

"Yes. There was a slight difference, but it's certain that an artifact with the magic 'Illusion (0|148100)' was used."

I had already anticipated to some extent, but the individuals involved in these deceptions were powerful figures. They were influential enough to grease the palms of high-ranking politicians, manipulate online public opinion, and even corrupt the judiciary system by accepting bribes.

"It seems like they belong to a large guild."

If they are ranked within the top 20, it's possible they belong to a major guild. Those guilds are like towering conglomerates standing apart from regular guilds.

They even nurtured an illegal mercenary group called the Black Hunters. I've seen it all.

"So, what kind of person is he?"

"He's a city dweller who fulfilled the romantic dream of returning to the countryside."

Kim Jibsa softly added a comment and handed me a tablet.

"Superficially, at least."

The tablet I received contained all the information about him.

He is now in his mid-40s and accumulated a considerable fortune through stock trading about ten years ago. However, due to recurring illness that caused him to collapse multiple times, he made the decision to return to the countryside.

"Illness?"

"There are medical diagnosis reports."

What kind of illness does a supply hunter have?

I chuckled and casually handed over the medical diagnosis report.

"This is all nonsense from the report. Trust me, my right wrist can confirm it."

Team Leader Choi nodded as if it was obvious.

"Then, I'll hang something on Mr. Jin Tae-kyung's right wrist."

Is this guy crazy? Why is he hanging something on my wrist?

Ignoring the bewildered gazes, Team Leader Choi continued speaking.

"No matter what he does, he appears perfectly ordinary on the surface. From the moment he settled down, he was sociable and even held village banquets every two weeks, eliminating any suspicion from the outsiders."

"Are there no skeptical people in a sparsely populated mountain village?"

"He's wealthy and has a good personality."

"It's suitable for hiding and doing something, like nurturing the Black Hunters."

I carefully examined the last scene.

A picturesque two-story detached house. The house looked relatively small compared to the spacious yard.

Beside the gray stone wall, there were a luxury sedan and an SUV parked.

"How many people could be inside? The attackers who raided Im Jeokjeong were only three in total. There's no reason for them to be scattered like Dragon Balls, so they must be inside that house."

Wait a minute, wait a minute.

"You mentioned earlier that he holds village banquets every two weeks."

"Yes, and every time, he orders a large amount of food ingredients from outside... Ah!"

The village banquets could be a camouflage to procure groceries.

"There might be more people involved than we originally thought."

If they're going to train, could the remaining members be hidden in the basement?

Or perhaps somewhere deep in the dense forest nearby?

This is just a personal wish, but it would be convenient if they were all gathered in the basement. That way, it would be easier to deal with.

"Approaching too directly might backfire. So, let's stop here for today..."

"You. Let's start slowly at this point."

I pressed my hood tightly and opened the car door.

"I'll be back."

"Understood?"

"Please come back in 20 minutes for the remaining three people. By that time, it should be close to finishing."

Their three bewildered gazes were fixed on me.

Kim Jibsa, the most experienced one, was the first to speak.

"Hunter Jin Tae-kyung, there's nothing to be afraid of as long as the unknown remains unverified."

"Yes, I'm aware."

"Although your skills are exceptional..."

Kim Jibsa's solemn voice continued.

"There may be dozens of Level 2 hunters, just like the ones I've been monitoring, waiting for us."

"It's okay. Rather than the dog, those inexperienced kids seemed stronger."

"Huh?"

"Oh, don't mind me. I just thought of an acquaintance."

Song Song-i asked with a lively voice, as if intrigued.

"You're thinking of an acquaintance at a time like this?"

"No, I'm always thinking of you."

"Cheesy."

"Quiet. Before I scold you for confessing."

"#Yuck!"

Ha, so cool. That's why girls flock to him.

Just when I was about to smoothly secure my first victory and get off the car, that's when it happened.

"I want to stop you, but I can't."

Team Leader Choi's expression was indescribable and mysterious as he spoke.

"Jin Tae-kyung has always succeeded in his crazy actions."

"You really saw people properly. Then, let's move as I suggested. It should be all over within an hour at the latest."

"Black Hunters... they're not monsters, but individuals trained to hunt humans. Be careful."

I couldn't help but smirk.

"Well, that works out nicely. That's also my area of expertise."

"What?"

Leaving the puzzled Team Leader Choi behind, I went outside.

Under the starry night sky of the countryside, cool breeze filling my lungs, I stretched and yawned.

As I walked towards the distant hideout of the Black Hunters, not as Hunter Jin Tae-kyung but as Jin Tae-kyung, a martial artist.

Grrrr.

In the pitch-black darkness, the eyes of beasts glinted.

I aimed my energy towards the two fierce guard dogs behind the iron bars, baring their teeth at me.

"If I hear any barking, you'll turn into bosintang."

Unless the guard dogs attended a Korean language school, they wouldn't understand a word.

But energy (*salgi) is a different story.

Honed in life-or-death battles and the crossroads of life and death, energy evoked primal fear.

Even someone with considerable courage would wet their pants, not to mention dogs, who are more sensitive to such things.



"Kkiing. Nillking."

The guard dogs, sensing the energy, hid their teeth and tucked their tails between their legs. Their restless eyes couldn't even look in my direction.

"Good dogs. Stay calm."

Swoosh.

As I stepped into the garden, my foot landed with the guidance of a spell (incantation) engraved in my hand. At that moment, along with the feeling of passing through a soft membrane, a loud siren echoed and spread.

Weeeeeeng!

Ding-a-ling.

- "Alarm Magic" has been activated!
- "Sound Block Magic" has been activated!
   All noise does not escape outside the mansion!
- "Sight Block Magic" has been activated!
   The interior cannot be seen from the outside!

Looks like they've taken precautions. This turned out better than expected.

As soon as the magic was activated, the lights inside the mansion brightly illuminated. Dozens of figures were seen frantically moving inside, and soon the iron front gate burst open like an explosion.

Bang!

The first to reveal their appearance were five men. Among them was 'Tail' in the center. The gaze of the seemingly ordinary middle-aged man had transformed into that of a killer.

144.95, Im Young-jun.

"You... I recognize your face.
Distorted face. Trembling eyes.
There's no mistaking that you recognize me.

I smiled widely at him.

"I came from the Village Youth Association."

"Jin Tae-kyung!"

"Not really. Just a piece of crap."

"How did you find this place?"

"We have a wealthy nobleman in our guild. That human is quite capable."

Im Young-jun looked around sharply.

"Don't tell me you're alone?"

"If I were alone?"

"I see."

His sarcastic smile twisted.

"You idiot. Even if you don't know the ways of the world, you should know them to some extent."

"That's what I wanted to say. You should observe the situation before proceeding with the job."

"Oh, that supposed hunter who doesn't even look like a Grade 1? Did you sell your arm?"

"I did, but... I have lingering effects. So I wanted to get some compensation."

"I almost killed you but held back. Be grateful it ended at that. If you don't want to see a worse sight, stay as still as a mouse."

"I've seen disgusting sights before, and pretending to be still like a mouse doesn't suit my temperament. I'm not particularly grateful for anything, so why did I come here?"

Im Young-jun smirked.

"Kid, I understand that you're thrilled to be admired by those around you, but it would be inconvenient if you saw us as ordinary hunters."

Indeed, the Black Hunters exuded a more intense aura and energy than typical hunters.

I glanced around the mansion. I could sense the presence of those hiding inside, waiting for orders.

"One, five, ten... Add them up, it's around twenty. Quite a gathering."

"...How did you know?"

"I'm not an ordinary hunter either."

I said, looking at the stern and rigid-faced man.

"Three. Including you, three who participated in the ambush two days ago. Disarm the rest and burn everything you know. Then I'll spare your lives."

"You crazy bastard."

"You must be relieved. I was worried about whether you would accept."

That was my first and final offer. There would be no next time.

Open inventory. Equip Baekyeom (Weapon※).

As the chilling presence of the spear gripped me, Im Young-jun shouted like a scream.

"Kill him!"

Those words were the signal.

Dozens of Black Hunters, who had been waiting for the command in silence, rushed towards me, breaking through walls and windows.

Bang! Shh... Shh... Shh... Silence!

Countless blades and arrowheads poured from all directions.

My eyes, watching over it all, had grown cold without me realizing.

"You guys messed with the wrong person."

Whoosh!
