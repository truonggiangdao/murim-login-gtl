"What would happen if you rolled a fist-sized snowball down a hill? Anyone know?"

To my question, Song Song-i let out a farting sound.

"A kindergartener could answer that."

"Then go ahead and answer."

"Obviously, it would get bigger as it rolls down, right?"

"Way to go. Why?"

"Well, because the snow accumulates as it rolls down the hill."

"Yup, just like my feelings for you."

"Uweh, uweh-ahh!"

This is addictive.

Taking advantage of the renewed sound of Song Song-i's laughter, I continued speaking.

"What Song-i said is correct. However, the premise is different here. This is not a snow-covered hill, but a melted one. Even if you roll it down with all your might, the snowball won't get much bigger."

"You're talking about a snowball made of mana, right?"

"Captain Choi catches on quickly. Yes, it's similar to the concept of mana manipulation. If the foundation is just specks of dust, no matter how much you roll it, it remains specks of dust."

"The lower the grade, the more limitations there are. That's what I understood, right?"

"Exactly."

I sighed.

"Once you reach a certain grade, it becomes as difficult as catching a star in the sky to surpass that level."

However, there are those with an extremely slim chance of catching that star.

Second Awakened Hunters. That's what they're called, and it's also the predicament I find myself in now, turned inside out.

"As a Class 2 Hunter, the effects of my second awakening have skyrocketed. Only then did a little bit of snow accumulate on the previously barren hill."

"By the way, what were the results at that time..."

"I had a mana capacity of (? grade). But even then, my control ability was at the 2nd grade. You know the reason, right?"

"The Law of Jeong-gasim."

Captain Choi groaned.

"So it wasn't a mistake on the Association's part."

When I became famous and my past achievements were revealed, that part was concluded as a measurement error.

Thanks to that, the Bucheon Association, which conducted the reevaluation at the time, received a lot of criticism. They must have felt quite unjust.

"Both Captain and Jipsa-nim refer to the Law of Jeong-gasim, which I call the Jeong-gasim Technique. It has two effects. The first is an increase in mana capacity. And the second is..."

Kim Jibsa took over the conversation.

"The control of mana flowing through the meridians."

The utilization of mana, also known as Qi (0), makes a world of difference depending on how it is used. The Jeong-gasim Technique is a peak martial art. Although the rate of Qi accumulation is slow, its stability is comparable to that of a supreme martial art.

"Even just mastering it will lead to significant achievements. Let the newcomers observe for now... and let those present here focus on learning the Jeong-gasim Technique for the time being. Oh, of course, it should be conducted in strict secrecy."

Why are their reactions like this?

A heavy silence fell in the hospital room. The four of them stared at me with their mouths wide open.

"Are you saying... you're going to teach us the mana manipulation technique?"

"Not just the mana manipulation technique, but the Jeong-gasim Technique."

"Oh, um, yes. The Jeong-gasim Technique."

Captain Choi's eyelids trembled.

"That's what you brought us here for?"

"Of course, that's the reason. Did you think I brought it just

 to show off?"

I looked at everyone and spoke again.

"As you all know, at our current level, we won't amount to much. Although Lee Jeong-ryong won't touch us right away due to recent incidents, it's only a matter of time. But... what if we had the Jeong-gasim Technique?"

Lim Jikjeong, who had been staring with his mouth open, shouted.

"Power! Agility! Technique!"

"Oh, great reactions! Well, the decision I've made after careful consideration needs to be followed without any formalities for now. Got it?"

The four of you here are the first ones, and next are the newly recruited hunters.

We will conduct a thorough evaluation to select them, and my plan is to turn them into hunters and martial artists at the same time.

We can handle a few elite hunters of the same level easily.

"Alright, then..."

I moved the people who were still halfway submerged one by one. And then I flicked my finger towards one person.

"Let's start with Team Leader Choe."

At that moment, a hologram window appeared above his still shocked face.

Ding!

- Quest, "[Let's Check Out Those Backs!]" has been activated!

Why does the title have to be like that? It's not appealing at all.

※ Attention ※ [Let's Check Out Those Backs!]

In contrast to the calmness of everyday life, the reality is tough!

Feeling the sense of crisis in this reality, you've decided to pass on your martial arts skills to trustworthy friends.

Whether this choice will be a poison or a gain... it depends on your decisions and abilities.

Let's wish for good luck! Beam of fortune (000)!

Rank: Adequate
Restrictions: Jin Tae-kyung
Mission: Guide the acquisition of [Jin's Supreme Technique] (incomplete)
Reward: Substantial amount of experience points
Repeatable quest???

Failure: In the worst case, fall into the trap of [excessive materialism].

Hmm, who came up with this quest title?

First of all, we need to explain how to use your well-known "Mingmun Blood" (@\7()) that exists in your spine. We should check out your back... but looking at the title, it suddenly makes me not want to say it in a vulgar way.

"Well, Team Leader Choe..."

Did I write that correctly?

"Oh, no, no. From now on, please follow my instructions. Kim Jipsa and the others, please guard the ward and make sure no outsiders enter. And especially, nobody should lay a hand on us. Understand?"

"Of course."

Kim Jipsa firmly nodded and began to unfold his magic. With each spell and staff movement, an invisible barrier spread and enveloped the ward.

Meanwhile, Team Leader Choe, who had taken off his upper garment, awkwardly sat cross-legged and presented his back to me.

"How do you plan to proceed with me?"

Your words sound quite strange.

Just forget about excessive materialism. Let's focus, my friend.

I placed my hand on Team Leader Choe's well-known "Mingmun Blood."

Now, we really have to be careful. Even the most skilled martial arts masters are defenseless when they enter a state of concentration.

"Close your eyes now and focus on the mana inside your body. No matter what happens, you must endure it. Is there any discomfort right now? If so, tell me."

"On the right side, near the waist... It's a bit..."

"Does it hurt?"

"It's itchy, though."

"Uh... Okay, there. Is it better now?"

Tap, tap.

As I applied pressure and massaged, Team Leader Choe's voice became more relaxed.

"Yes, it feels much better now. Thank you."

"My nickname used to be Hyoja-son."

"And the underwear is a bit tight..."

"Are you crazy? You have to take care of that yourself. Did I put the handcuffs on you?"

"Oh, I didn't know there was such a method. I'm feeling very nervous right now."

"Well, it's alright. I apologize if I made you feel embarrassed unnecessarily."

"Tae-kyung, it's not your fault. If I had known this would happen, I would have worn underwear."

Seems like someone who knows how to wear underwear... I warned Team Leader Choe in a calm voice.

"If you say anything unnecessary from now on, it's over for you. Just focus on how and where the mana flows."

"Understood."

"Even if it's itchy or uncomfortable in the underwear, you have to endure it. Do you understand?"

"Do you think I have a clear idea of what we're trying to do?"

"We will manipulate Team Leader's mana using Jin Kidoin (8뿌8|). After that, we'll follow the principles of Jin's Supreme Technique and perform Un-Gi Jo-Sik (배스08) to conclude."

"Do you understand it roughly? Be honest."

"Honestly?"

Choi Team Leader, who had been silent for a moment, responded, "I don't understand Jin Kidoin."

"Then just close your eyes and do as I say. If you say anything about your underwear or anything like that, and wiggle your butt, I'll kill you before I die."

"I will keep that in mind."

A resolute answer. The tense body of Team Leader Choe, which had been stiffened, gradually relaxed.

He is a beginner taking his first steps into the unfamiliar world of martial arts.

It doesn't matter how much social experience Team Leader Choe has accumulated or how proficient he is in different languages or what knowledge he possesses.

"Well then, let's begin."

Everything is at stake for me in this situation.

I cautiously regulated my breath and channeled the refined power from my dantian through the palm of my hand into Team Leader Choe's body. Take it slow, and be careful.

Swoosh.

As the energy surged into him, it felt like the system was giving a signal.

Ding.

- [Jin Kidoin] has started.

I've helped remove impurities from my mom and Ha-yeon's bodies before, but this is a whole new level of difficulty. Jin Kidoin is about guiding the energy inside someone's body in the direction I want. And the energy possessed by Team Leader Choe is incredibly abundant, way beyond what an average person has.

And surprisingly, it's really clean.

Actually, let me correct that. It's not just surprisingly clean; it's exceptionally impressive.

His muscles and blood vessels are strong and free of any impurities, like a clean and smooth highway in the early morning.

"What's this? You mentioned not having learned mana manipulation techniques."

Team Leader Choe is an 8th-grade Hunter, and the aura he gives off is just about that level.

The only thing that's a bit lacking is his connection to Cheon Tae-min. He's missing out on exceptional leadership, a sharp mind, and resolute decision-making.

But despite all that, he's still underestimated.

No one should underestimate the name of Cheon Tae-min, the hero who saved humanity.

However, my thoughts have shifted a bit now.

"With this level... he can easily reach new heights with a little help."

He's not just an urgent hunter. I want to elevate Team Leader Choe to become an outstanding master. It would be a shame to leave his natural potential untapped.

"If others could reach even half of Team Leader Choe's skill, things would be much easier."

With such pleasant thoughts, I let the energy flow into him. Before I knew it, an incredible power was enveloping his body, and the remaining impurities were swiftly eliminated by the intense heat.

"Now, the final step."

Now that I've gathered and organized the scattered energy, it's time to store it in his dantian. Then, the Iljuncheon (-)※※) will be complete, and I can take my first steps as a skilled martial artist.

"What's this?"

As I reached Team Leader Choe's dantian, I suddenly came to a halt.

A massive cluster of energy occupied half of his dantian. And there was a system notification.

Ding.

- Unexpected quest, [I'll only take half of the absorbed power], has been activated.

- Do you want to accept it?
