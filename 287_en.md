Me, Eokjeong, Song Song-i, and Kim Jipsa.

However, Jeongryong's gaze, as he entered the hospital room, was fixed on one person.

It was Team Leader Choi.

"You've grown up a lot."

Sui Ahhiji.

The moment I heard Jeongryong's first words, it felt like I had been hit on the back of my head with a sledgehammer.

So this was what Team Leader Choi had been hiding.

It was clear that their relationship went beyond a simple superior-subordinate dynamic.

"From what I know, Team Leader Choi was with the Ares Guild for about three to four years. Even if we assume a shorter period, he would have met Jeongryong when he was in his mid-twenties. Such a statement doesn't suit someone like him.

That's something you hear from your parents' friends or relatives on holidays.

"It's been a long time. Guild Master Jeongryong."

With a firm tone and manner of speech, Jeongryong stared at Team Leader Choi with an interested look.

"Guild Master? You used to call me grandfather when you were young."

Grandfather?

That's the second shock. For a moment, I wondered if... but I quickly erased the thought from my mind.

This is simply a matter of honorifics. Jeongryong must have called him grandfather in his young heart, but Team Leader Choi is not his real grandfather.

It seems clear that Team Leader Choi had a close relationship with Jeongryong from a young age.

Just that fact alone makes it extraordinary.

Amidst everyone's surprise, the only person maintaining composure and calmly responding was Kim Jipsa.

"So it was like that. Twenty years ago..."

"Time flies. I never thought that mischievous little kid would change like this."

"The things that used to be invisible are becoming more and more visible."

"I heard that you submitted your resignation last year. Thinking about it, I realized that I've never seen your face since you joined the guild. I secretly felt a bit disappointed."

Contrary to his words, there was no sign of disappointment on his face. Team Leader Choi's response was the same.

"I feel the same way. If only you hadn't immediately been sent on an overseas assignment and had a chance to come to headquarters more often."

"Why, didn't you like the overseas branch?"

"I felt it wasn't where I belonged. That's all."

"Not where you belong..."

"Guild Master, isn't that the painting you wanted?"

"Are you speaking to me?"

Jeongryong smirked and burst into laughter.

"So, you've set up a new nest? Going as far as borrowing someone else's name?"

"I apologize for interrupting, but..."

Kim Jipsa, who had been maintaining silence, suddenly spoke up. His voice was as calm as ever.

"It's not just you and me left, Guild Master."

"No, who is this?"

Jeongryong widened his eyes in surprise.

It was an exaggerated reaction. If he knew Team Leader Choi, he would undoubtedly know Kim Jipsa, who was closest to him.

"Kim Hwajong? It's Hwajong, right?"

"It's been a while, senior."

Kim Jipsa didn't refuse Jeongryong's extended hand. The two of them smiled and shook hands, exuding a warm atmosphere.

"Using banmal? And calling me senior?"

Regardless of their exact relationship, it was apparent that they were closer than expected.

"You did well to come in person. The last time we met was... about 20 years ago, wasn't it?"

"More precisely, it's been 18 years. Eighteen

 years."

Maybe it was my mood, but it felt like there was a lump in my throat at certain words.

Sadly, when I turned to look, Song Song-i and Im Geokjeong had expressions as if they had seen a ghost.

"Oh, it's not because of my mood. They're not as close as I thought. I must have been mistaken.

Let me correct that. Kim Jipsa not only dislikes Jeongryong, but he also despises him.

Jeongryong, still smiling, spoke.

"Hwajong, I thought you had turned pale since we last saw each other."

It was a meaningful pause. However, despite his subtly pressuring words, Kim Jipsa's gaze remained unwavering.

"When people find peace in their hearts, their spirits become clear."

"Peace?"

"After rescuing a nobleman from a tiger's jaw, I felt relieved inside. Courage has always been a part of me."

"Hahaha! That's right. Once you made up your mind, you didn't hesitate. It's thanks to your fearless nature that I also survived."

"I remember. Hangang."

"Yes, Hangang. The day when Mapo Bridge collapsed. You still remember the tragedy."

"I think about it whenever I have a chance and regret it. If I hadn't saved our senior at that time, we wouldn't be facing these circumstances now."

Let me clarify. Kim Jipsa doesn't just dislike Lee Jung-ryong.

He hates him intensely. He wishes Lee Jung-ryong were dead instead.
Though he never drew a sword as a wizard, his words were sharper than any blade.

Upon hearing his criticism, Seok Go-jun, who had been standing rigidly behind Lee Jung-ryong, took a step forward.

"Be careful with your words."

"Careful?"

"He's not someone you should disrespect."

Kim Jipsa looked at Seok Go-jun with a strange look in his eyes.

"At first glance, you seem exceptionally skilled. What's your name, Hunter?"

"I'm Seok Go-jun, responsible for protecting Guild Master Bu's safety."

"I see. Team Leader Seok Go-jun."

Kim Jipsa's unique low-pitched voice trailed off gently.

"Now that you've said everything, shut your mouth and stay behind. You have no place to interfere."

Damn it,
Seok Go-jun's already expressionless face hardened even more.

As a vein popped on his forehead at that moment, Lee Jung-ryong burst into laughter and pushed Seok Go-jun back.

"I thought you had become more docile with age... but your fiery temperament is still there. Yes, that's the Kim Hwa-jong I know."

"If we're going to judge someone based on their unpleasant temperament, I should take a step back from you, Senior. Don't you think so?"

Team Leader Choi also added a cold voice.

"Enough with the useless conversation, please get to the point."

How many people in South Korea, no, in the world, can speak so casually to Lee Jung-ryong?

In the midst of the stormy conversation, Im Jik-jeong and Song Song's mouths hung open in astonishment.

In particular, Kim Jipsa's appearance was strikingly different from his usual self, even surprising Lee Jung-ryong, who had witnessed him rolling Guild Master Im Chun-su like a puppy a few months ago.

"What on earth happened? Both Team Leader Choi and Kim Jipsa... It's too different from their usual selves."

"Did you say it's an invitation?"

"You must be mistaken. No one here is inviting Guild Master Bu."

"Think about it carefully. There must be at least one person."

Lee Jung-ryong suddenly turned his head towards me, looking at me with an amused expression.

"That friend over there."

A moment of silence fell.

Within the gaze of the people, I, who had been lost in thought for a moment, cautiously spoke up.

"What nonsense are you talking about?"

Before I could finish my sentence, Seok Go-jun growled lowly. If Lee Jung-ryong hadn't turned his head sideways, he would have pounced on me like a hunting dog.

Lee Jung-ryong restrained Seok Go-jun and spoke to me.

"Weren't you like that? Coming to the victim personally and apologizing."

I did say such words to Park Ji-hoon and Park Tae-seop.

"It seems like you didn't know the truth."
"Honestly, that's correct. Coming all the way here, what kind of trickery is this?"

"You have a tendency to speak your mind without holding back. Since you accepted the invitation, shouldn't you start with a word of gratitude?"

A word of gratitude?

I let out a sigh. I couldn't even muster a response to his unexpected remark.

"Even if your appearance is disheveled, you should speak properly. It wasn't an invitation; it was a demand. A demand for an apology."

"No, if coming here wasn't my intention, could you or the Peace Guild have made me take even a single step?"

"What about it?"

"I thought you also felt the same way. That you didn't know the truth."

It felt like a bucket of cold water had been poured over me. I was at a loss for words.

Everything he said was true.

In my heart, I wanted to scream with anger and seek revenge, but I didn't expect Lee Jeong-ryong to apologize. In the midst of it all, my mind remained rational, compromising with reality.

I couldn't expect to kneel down in this position against Lee Jeong-ryong, the true ruler of the Ares Guild, using my own strength.

"Demanding is the right of the strong. The words of the weak can never become demands. It's all a request, an invitation."

Seoyahiji...

"So, I came here in response to the invitation. Even if you and your group try to exploit any weaknesses, that fact remains unchanged. I am Lee Jeong-ryong. I am the Ares Guild, and the Ares Guild is me."

With a calm yet powerful voice, including myself, the members of the Peace Guild were speechless.

At least one thing was clear. Lee Jeong-ryong didn't come here to apologize.

His eyes widened. Is this "Nung" referring to martial arts, by any chance?

However, Lee Jeong-ryong was already not paying attention to what I was saying. He stared at Chief Choi with a calm expression.

"Did So-young have another man?"

I don't know who So-young is.

But that name seemed to be a touchy subject for someone.

Chief Choi clenched his fist, and a blue flame flickered in Kim's eyes.

"Senior, do you want to die?"

"Answer me."

"You bastard! Lee Jeong-ryong!"

"What?"

Chief Choi's tightly sealed lips opened at that moment.

"Don't you know better than me about their relationship?"

"Then what about that guy...?"

"You must have already investigated Mr. Jin Tae-kyung, haven't you?"

"Is everything you said true?"

"It's exactly as you know. There's not a single lie."

Lee Jeong-ryong's pupils trembled.

The person who had been alternating his gaze between me and Chief Choi slowly turned around. As if waiting, he stopped when the door opened. A word was thrown out.

"We will send someone soon. After the negotiation is over, hand over the guys you're holding."

Click. The door closed after the last person, Hunter Seo Go-jun, who lifted up Jun Seok-go with plaster. It felt like a whirlwind had swept through the room.

I silently looked at Chief Choi, who was staring at the closed door.

"Who is So-young?"

"She's my mother."

What?

"That's what my mother used to be called. Although she passed away a long time ago."

Without realizing it, my mouth fell open.

Lee Jeong-ryong. Did he see the insane Eun and ask if his deceased mother had an affair with his own child?

"Crazy. Why... Ah, no. You don't have to answer."

"Lee Jeong-ryong's shock seems to have affected me. I didn't know I would ask such a direct question."

Shock or whatever. I quickly reached out my hand.

"Hey, Chief. It's really okay. You don't have to answer."

"Sometimes, I think about that. What if my mother had been born to someone other than Cheon Tae-min, I wonder."

"Okay, I get it now..."

Suddenly, my body froze.

"What did you just say?"

Despite my bewildered state, my mouth repeated three words faster than ever.

Cheon Tae-min. Cheon Tae-min. Cheon Tae-min...

"Just now, you said Cheon Tae-min, right?"

"If I heard your pronunciation correctly, then you heard it right."

"Could it be... the Cheon Tae-min I know?"

"Yes."

Chief Choi, who raised his head, spoke.

"He is my grandfather."

In an instant, my vision became dizzy, and my legs trembled.

"Cheon Tae-min. Cheon Tae-min..."

There was a time when I had suspicions about Chief Choi's true identity.

An incredibly wealthy person with no end in sight (#7), a hidden hero of the Great Change, a 20-something man referred to as "the hunter that even Doyeon calls the world's best magician."

Now I finally understand how all of these things were possible.

It was because his great-grandfather was Cheon Tae-min.

"The great hero born of mankind. The Slayer (519060)."

The title "Ares Guild Leader" that accompanies Cheon Tae-min is just a small fragment. The name of the biggest piece is an achievement of immortality that no one else can achieve.

"The one who killed the Demon King. The Slayer

 (519060)."

Right in front of me stands the great-grandson of Cheon Tae-min.
