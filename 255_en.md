Udangtang!

Jeok Chun-gang, who stood up from his seat in a crawling manner, didn't even notice that the chair was round.

All his attention was focused on one person only, Jong-ri Choo.

"This."

It was a brief moment, but I definitely felt it.
The air waves emitted from the pendulum were so powerful that it instantly caught my attention.

"Rebuttal return 08 rat 0080... You were hiding your power," muttered Papa Guengdao, sounding shocked.

Returning back. It's a level that makes you appear like an ordinary person despite your martial arts skills. Your internal energy surges, allowing you to control your own momentum effortlessly.

To reach this level, one must transcend the peak and enter the realm beyond. The realm of transcendence (808) reserved for great warriors only.

"That young guy is a master of transcendence?
Are you guys crazy? Does that even make sense?" exclaimed the king of Byeokryukdo, urging Goengdo and Jeokcheongang.

"Amitabha. So, Peng Shiju, how do you explain this situation?"

"He has reached the stage of rebuttal.
And that's enough to deceive our eyes."

Those in the upper seats who were eavesdropping on the conversation chimed in.
From the preliminaries until now, Jong Lichu has always narrowly passed. Was he even ridiculed with the infamous title of the lifelong sword?

But not anymore.

For a brief moment, the energy I sensed from that fortunate young warrior was enough to send shivers down the spines of the heads of the five great families and the dominating Gupafang.

"What is this...?"

The king of Byeokryeokdo couldn't continue speaking and fell silent. He, too, was a master of the highest level and one of the Ten Kings. In his heart, he agreed with the thoughts of Tiangang and Hong Dao, but he couldn't easily accept it.

"How can someone who hasn't even reached separation become a transcendent master?"

Just then, as the king of the thunderstorm muttered in a lamenting tone, a person who had been quietly observing the situation suddenly spoke up.

"It's possible."

"Huh?"

All eyes turned in the same direction. Cheonmyeonhori Songho added a word, as if daring them to challenge his statement.

"If it's half-roof (& gun ball) 3, I'm sorry."

Setting aside the astonishment spreading among the audience, Song-ho leaned back in his chair and gazed intently at his pendulum.

"Who are you really?"

The more questions grew in his mind, the more pain he felt from the scar that had been cut decades ago. Song-ho now knew that this was no mere coincidence.

He had a deep connection to the day he became a one-legged man.

"Reveal your true identity."

At that moment, the judge's flag swung vigorously towards the sky.

※ ※ ※
shhh!

A red line swung without hesitation.
Cheongpung, who had been standing still and blindfolded, turned around belatedly.

However, Zhonglichu's strike was faster than he expected.

Awesome!

A searing pain radiated from his chest. A red dot sprouted from the island in front of the long cut.

An intense smell of blood that stung the nose.

Stumbling back, Qin Qingfeng looked at Zhonglichu with a bewildered gaze.
The person he thought was a friend, no, was staring at Cheongpung with an unbearably calm gaze.

"Sorry. It was too shallow."

As he said that, the sword wound was indeed shallow. There was only a slight tear on the skin, but no other injuries.

However, the wounds suffered by Cheongpung were not limited to the physical.

"Joe, bell pepper."

Having lived in Moorim, no, for twenty-two years, he had never experienced a friend like Sa Kwon before.

The person who had extended his hand first, suggesting friendship, now pointed a sword at himself. Without hesitation, he swung his sword and cut his chest.

"What the hell are you doing?"

"I don't understand what you mean."

Zhonglichu calmly wiped off the blood from his sword.

"Isn't this Moorim? Can you believe it? Just a few conversations, and you didn't trust me when I was new to you, right?"

C.I.,
"Judging by your expression, it seems to be true.
Huh, how did you manage to survive with such a naive mindset? I heard you're a disciple of the Volcano Sect."

Jong-ri-chu glanced at the patriarch Jang-in and the seated Cheon-gum-in at the head of the table, searching for his words.

"Jang Moon-in taught me in a haphazard way. It was terrible."

At those words, the tightly sealed lips of the blue wind parted. Unlike before, his voice, now devoid of honorifics, was low.

"The person who taught me martial arts is my grandfather, not him."

"Really? I don't know who your grandfather is, but he must be an old man losing his mind. What's his nickname?"

"The Sword Saint."

"The Sword Master Masonry?"

When the blue wind nodded, a startled exclamation erupted from the previously silent audience.

There was not a single person here who didn't know the prestige of Geomseong Maijonghak. His name had long become a living legend. However, during the turbulent times when Kangsan changed hands several times, a disciple of the swordsman emerged.

It's him!

Numerous people blinked their eyes in shock, but only one person, Jong Lichu, had a different reaction.

"As a disciple of the Sword Saint... "

Zhonglichu, habitually stroking his smooth chin, smiled.

"Then the Sword Saint is no big deal."

Sighing, Cheongpung suddenly recalled what his grandfather used to say.

"Always remember, the world is vast and full of the strong. Your martial arts are not yet complete, so you should always be cautious of those with malicious intentions."

Even so, the words didn't make much sense. Hwasan was peaceful, and my time at Maesong was enjoyable.

However, one day, his curiosity about the outside world grew, and he eventually ventured out without his grandfather's knowledge.
"Hey, this is it."

It seemed that now he understood what it meant.

The only painful part was that he realized it after shedding blood on his friend's sword for the first time in his life.

Grandfather.

Cheongpung tightly grasped the sword. The strong scent of blood tickled his nose, clearing his mind.

Swoosh!

With the sound of his hair standing on end, a white sword body emerged.
Simultaneously, the dormant qi within his danjeon surged like a cloud, enveloping his blood vessels and spreading throughout his body.

Swish, swish, swish!

Ja Ha Gong (※ Haegyeok 9). A unique self-generated power emanated from Cheongpung's body. Without realizing it, his eyes, tinged with the setting sun, focused on the pendulum.

"You will regret this."

"Then where...?"

The sword, previously hanging from the bell weight, was now slung over Jonglichu's shoulder.

"Let's see your skills."
Hey, profit!

Cheongpung tilted his head. Jonglichu's sword, which had easily passed through Cole like a sheet of paper, was now covered in red rust instead of blood.

"Fast!"

Although Cheongpung had followed his grandfather's teachings and mastered the extreme rising prosthesis technique (8 ※), Jonglichu's movements surpassed his own.

As the alarm bell rang in his head, sword attacks continued like crashing waves.

Clang! Shhhhhh!

The sword blade, about to pierce his chest, was caught in mid-air.

He wanted to strike back, but then Jonglichu evaded his attack, and just as he thought he was about to strike again, an unexpected projectile flew towards his shoulder.

Thud!

"Ouch!"

Cheongpung, struck by an unexpected shot in the shoulder, was sent flying a dozen steps back.

It was the moment when his spinning airborne feet finally touched the ground.

shed!
The bluestone beneath their feet crumbled into powder and dispersed into the air. The blue wind charged towards Jonglichu with an even greater speed.

His sword, drawing forth the ethereal light, moved with elegance, creating a blossoming display.

Swoosh!

Thirty-six swords, representing the mastery of eight castles, flew from all directions towards Jonglichu.

Suddenly, a smirk formed on Jonglichu's face, surrounded by an aura of dark, heavy energy. It was a laugh that seemed out of place in such a dire situation.

"This exceeds my expectations."

Before he could finish his words, his sword swung into action.

In an instant, a blinding flash of light and a thunderous roar engulfed the scene, leaving spectators struggling to keep their eyes open.

Slash! Kaaaa!

Blazing swordsmanship and shattered fragments filled the air.

As the thick cloud of dust settled, a figure emerged.

Cheongpung's eyes widened as he watched Jonglichu, coughing with his hand over his mouth.

"This person...")

This time, he seemed cunning. Jonglichu effortlessly deflected every single sword technique with the movement of his pendulum.

Despite wielding a rusty sword, it faced dozens of sword techniques with the strength of steel.

Jonglichu didn't even need a sword. He effortlessly flowed through the motions as if it were second nature.

"How is this possible?"

Cheongpung was both astonished and overwhelmed by a strange sensation he had never experienced before in his life. The thunderous beats of his racing heart echoed, and his grip on the sword trembled involuntarily.

At that moment, a single drop of sweat dripped from Cheongpung's forehead and fell onto the ground.

"Are you afraid?"

Jonglichu's steps were leisurely, as if he were strolling. His deep, calm gaze sent a shiver down Cheongpung's spine.

And in that moment, Cheongpung realized that the unfamiliar sensation he had just felt had a name.

"Fear."

It was a feeling unlike anything he had ever experienced before.

The unfamiliar sensation of fear, something he had only heard about from his grandfather, was gripping Cheongpung's body and mind.

"Poongah, do you know fear?"

"Fear? What is it?"

"It's something that lies deep within everyone's heart. Not recognizing fear is your greatest weakness."

Swordsman Maijonghak held a deep love for his grandson, despite not being blood-related. He always looked upon Cheongpung with warm eyes, watching over him day and night.

Just like beautiful flowers blossoming from fertile soil, Cheongpung grew up as a delightful child.

"It's my fault. I have failed..."

She only knew how to love because she had grown up receiving boundless affection.

On the mountaintop where they lived together, there was no room for arrogance, greed, jealousy, or anger that prevailed in the outside world.

"If that day comes, don't let fear consume you. That's all I can say."

These were the words Cheongpung heard the day before he secretly escaped from Yeonhwabong.

Maybe my grandfather knew this would happen.

However, Cheongpung found himself taking backward steps without even realizing it when faced with a formidable opponent he had never encountered before.
"Grandpa, how am I doing?"

*Thunk*

As the bell weight took one step forward, the blue wind retreated. And then one more step.
One more step.

Despite the distance that seemed impossible to bridge, Cheonglichu raised his sword.

"There is no end. I had expected more from a student of the Sword Saint, but is this all you have?"

"Me, I..."

"You probably don't understand what it means to lose in Murim."

*Sigh*
Ghostly movements.

Trapped in fear, Cheongpung was unable to react. It felt as if only the bell weight was alive, moving in a world that had slowed down.
The previously insurmountable distance vanished with a single step, and the sword approached with a sliding motion.

It was the moment when the rusty blade of the sword was about to dig into Cheongpung's neck.

"Say ae ae ae! Shed!"

A terrifying explosion of power, a thunderous roar erupted.
In an instant, Zonglichu turned his sword to block the attack and grinned at the transparent spear blade.

"A good friend, after all."

"Not a friend, but a benefactor. But... ah"
Jin Tae-kyung cleared his throat and continued.

"What are you doing, you bastard?"
