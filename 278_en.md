The once beautiful two-story house had transformed into a gruesome abode (45).

If the dozens of defensive barriers hadn't partially absorbed the impact of the Destruction Fist, it would have turned into a pile of ashes.

At that moment, I felt a sensation behind me, and a familiar voice echoed in my ears.

"Jin Tae-kyung."

I turned my head, sitting on a half-charred sofa, and confidently replied, "Yes?"

Team Leader Choi and Housekeeper Kim, along with Song Song, were there.

The gaze in their eyes as they looked at me seemed complicated. It might have been a natural reaction after witnessing the bodies scattered in the garden.

Considering my blood-soaked appearance, I didn't look particularly pleased either.

Song Song cautiously asked, "Did you... kill them all?"

"Yes."

Swiftly, I added with a soft tone, "Except for those who surrendered. They're alive."

It was a response to Song Song, but also a statement directed at Team Leader Choi and Housekeeper Kim.

Team Leader Choi asked with a worried expression, "Are there any casualties?"

"As you can see, there are none."

"What about the survivors?"

"They're gathered in one place, hidden during the daytime."

"Are you telling me you haven't taken any measures?"

"Of course, I have. For the next few hours, they might as well be breathing corpses, so don't worry."

Personal measures meant draining their blood, both arterial and venous, and preserving the remaining Black Hunters in one of the few rooms.

Although we subdued them forcefully, I had no intention of killing even the surrendering individuals. They might come in handy later.

"Well done. But..."

Team Leader Choi's gaze shifted to someone lying beneath my feet.

"Who is that?"

"The owner of this house."

As I kicked the body, the appearance of a man in his forties became visible.

He was the house owner and the leader of the Black Hunters, Im Young-jun.

Although his body was drenched in blood to the point of being mistaken for a corpse, he was undoubtedly alive and without a single scratch.

Housekeeper Kim, examining the body, muttered as if he knew something.

"You've used potions. Multiple times, it seems."

"Just a little something."

"The use of torture?"

"You have a keen eye."

"At the time of the Great Transformation, it was a common occurrence. There were even worse individuals than Black Hunters."

At the mention of torture, Song Song's complexion darkened. However, she soon sighed and placed her hand on my shoulder.

"You've been through a lot."

It's natural to feel repulsed. Even someone like me, who is accustomed to the world of martial arts, feels uneasy.

But Im Yeong-jun turned out to be more formidable than I had anticipated. It would have been difficult to crack his stubbornness with mere threats.

"They weren't ordinary people. It was something that someone had to do."

"If Jin Tae-gyeong Hunter didn't do it, I would have. Don't worry too much," Chief Choi and Kim Jipsa added their own words.

Yes, just like what they said, someone had to do it. In a courtyard stained with blood that was already in my hands, there was no reason to hesitate about torture.

I shook my head and spoke, relieving my troubled mind.

"There's no evidence left. As soon as I infiltrated and triggered the alarm spell, I deleted all the related information."

"Are you sure you got rid of everything?"

"Yes, I am. There were no computers in the house, and only two people, including Im Yeong-jun, had untraceable burner phones."

I showed them the remains of the phones that I had prepared in advance.

Even someone like Chief Choi, who was well-versed in such matters, thought it was impossible to recover anything from them.

"You've done a meticulous job. At this point, there shouldn't be any documents or traces left behind."

"What about the remaining Black Hunters?"

"There were ten survivors, but none of them seem to know anything. The deputy leader among them died at my hands. They were all recruited and trained by Im Yeong-jun."

According to my investigation, they operated as a well-organized group.

From identity laundering to payment distribution, everything concerning the Black Hunters went through Im Yeong-jun.

"I'm glad that Im Yeong-jun is still alive. What did he say?"

"That... missing text"

I suddenly stopped speaking.

The one phrase he shouted amidst the three rounds of agony was still echoing in my mind.

"명동 Guild! It's the 명동 Guild!"

It was a large guild that was ranked within the top 20 domestically, even though they couldn't compare to the top 10. And "Jihoon."

It was also the guild where an old friend I recently reunited with belonged.

After contemplating for a moment, I spoke again, "Can I have a little time?"

"Time for what?"

"Because I have a personal matter to confirm."

Chief Choi, who had been silently looking at me, nodded.

"I'll take care of the scene first. Check it and let me know."

"Yes."

"Let's get started right away."

At Chief Choi's words, Kim Jipsa swung his staff-like cane, and the tightly closed door opened. The ten Black Hunters, who had been floating in mid-air, floated out of the house one by one.

Im Yeong-jun was among them, of course.

"Everyone, step back."

Kim Jipsa warned in a low voice, and the order echoed.

Mana surged, and a massive fire engulfed the two-story house that had barely maintained its form.

The flames spread to the garden, and it wouldn't stop until everything was reduced to ashes.

Crackle!

The fire was accompanied by thick smoke billowing up.

However, the peace of the quiet countryside village where the mansion was located remained undisturbed.

The mansion, where all sight and sound were blocked by magic, would not be discovered until much later.

"Will this be enough?"

"This should be sufficient. Even if it's not us, those guys will come forward to erase the existence of this place."

People disappeared overnight, and the house burned down, but that was all.

Nothing else would happen, except for gossip circulating among the villagers for a while.

That's how monsters with power and authority operated.

But there was one thing that I was curious about.

[Former schoolmate Garam Jung, Park Jihoon]

Whose number is stored in my phone right now?

In the dim dawn, Park Jihoon dressed and prepared his belongings.

At the entrance, a chauffeur in formal attire was waiting for him.

"Have you arrived?"

"What's going on? Why at this hour?"

"I don't really know. I just received an order from the guild leader to pick you up."

Well, what can a mere chauffeur know?

Park Jihoon, with a chilly expression, got into the car. The road was deserted, probably because it was still early in the morning.

After a while, the luxurious limousine stopped in Hannam-dong, a neighborhood filled with high-end apartments and villas.

A grand mansion. One of the security guards who had been standing guard along the stone wall ran up to Park Jihoon and bowed his head.

"He's waiting inside."

Park Jihoon passed through the iron gate that resembled a European noble mansion, crossed the spacious garden wider than a playground, and finally met the person who had summoned him.

"Have you had breakfast?"

He was a man in his early fifties, around fifty, but his physique was dignified regardless of his age. Muscular chest development could be seen beyond his white robe.

Park Jihoon bowed his head and replied, "I haven't eaten yet, sir."

"Then come in. The beef bone soup turned out really well today."

It was already 6 a.m., and it's not a delightful morning to wake up and eat breakfast this early.

However, Park Jihoon picked up the utensils without a word and expressed his gratitude before starting to eat.

"Aren't you going to eat, Guild Leader?"

"I've already eaten. Don't worry and finish your meal."

Nonchalantly, he replied and unfolded the newspaper. It was today's morning edition.

On the front page was a picture of a middle-aged man in a suit, bowing his head with a sorrowful expression.
"Park Tae-seop, Myeongdong Guild Leader, who visited Jeong Hyeon-woo's funeral. 'Only remorseful feelings, bowing my head to the bereaved family.'"

Park Jihoon finally understood why he was summoned.

'The fortune teller must have hit the nail on the head.'

Without taking his eyes off the man in the colored photo, who looked exactly like him, Park Jihoon sipped his soup.

"How's the picture? Does it look good?"

"Well, since you're such a good-looking person..."

"That's the problem with you. No matter what you say, it always sounds empty."

"I'm being sincere."

With a firm response, the Guild Leader Park Tae-seop's eyebrows twitched.

It was a sign that his patience had reached its limit.

"Jeong Hyeon-woo. Why did you kill him?"

Here it comes.

Park Jihoon calmly put down his utensils and boldly replied, "I smelled something."

"You should have stopped at just blocking his nose."

"That's the role Myeongdong Guild should play. My role is to bite the necks of those who smell rotten before they start buzzing somewhere."

"Without my approval?"

"Do I need your approval to receive Hirak?"

Crack!

Park Tae-seop's fist slammed down on the table. With a sharp sound, the table shattered, and glass and food scattered in all directions.

"Guild Leader!"

The urgent cry that awaited the approaching bodyguards was filled with anger.

"Everyone, get the hell out of here! Don't take a single step until I give you an order!"

Sssk!

The moment the stunned individuals lowered their heads and stepped back.

Park Jihoon casually took out a handkerchief and wiped the soup off his face.

"Too bad. It was delicious."

"How dare that rotten-smelling bastard..."

"After all, we both smell rotten. Adding a stinky smell won't make a difference."

"I built my guild shedding blood. But you, without a word, killed a guild member?"

"Well, Guild Leader."

Park Jihoon's smooth forehead, free of any wrinkles, furrowed.

The remnants of the shattered table and torn handkerchief fell onto the table.

"What do you suggest then?"

"What?"

"Don't you know how troublesome it can be when those who smell rotten start talking? Once this sparks, it will burn down the entire household. If you want to burn down your own livelihood, I won't say anything, but since it will spread to our side as well, that's why I stepped in."

"But this bastard...!"

"And if you could handle what you took on properly. A war hero who fought in the great upheaval, shedding blood? I acknowledge that. But claiming Myeongdong Guild as your own guild... it's a bit..."

Park Jihoon chuckled and straightened up from his seat.

"I enjoyed the breakfast. Although I couldn't take many bites."

Watching him, Park Tae-seop, who had been trembling, opened his mouth.

"Sit down."

"If you have anything more to say, please call me. Because if you keep doing this, my respect for you as a senior will disappear."

"I said sit down."

The air around them became tense.

Park Tae-seop, the Myeongdong Guild Leader, was a hero of the great upheaval and one of the top-ranked hunters in the country.

However, Park Jihoon knew that he couldn't lay a hand on him.

"Next time, perhaps."

With a polite bow, as he turned to leave, Park Tae-seop spoke up.

"Because of the sparks you caused, the entire household is at risk of burning down. Didn't you realize that?"

"What are you talking about? Jeong Hyeon-woo's matter has been thoroughly handled to prevent any loose ends."

"The Black Hunter. You recently crossed paths with a Class 1 hunter from the Peace Guild, didn't you?"

Park Jihoon's face hardened.

He sensed that a serious problem had arisen.

"What is it? What has happened?"

At that moment, Park Jihoon's cellphone, tucked in his coat pocket, began to vibrate.

As if possessed, he pulled out the phone and stared at the screen, filled with a name.

[Jin Tae-kyung]
