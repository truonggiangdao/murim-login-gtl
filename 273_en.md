"Hello!"

"Hello!"

I feel like a gang boss. Every time I walk, I have to greet people from all directions, bending my back on the ninetieth street, thanks to the new guild members.

They are just rookies who have recently completed their training. In terms of seniority, I am much older than them.

"But on this floor, we don't pay much attention to seniority."

The problem is that among the new guild members, there are some hunters who are older than me.

"It's an honor to meet you!"

A newcomer who appears to be in his mid-thirties bowed with sparkling eyes.

I feel more awkward looking at his prominent forehead than his gaze.

"Yes, stay strong..."

"Thank you!"

"Thank you!"

Echoing, what's this?

And I didn't say it to you, you bunch of enthusiastic folks.

Quietly, while observing the newcomers with a sense of annoyance, my gaze suddenly stopped at a young man.

"He seems different."

He is the shortest among the new recruits this time. His presence and every movement are restrained like a monk.

The young man who noticed my gaze smiled and said.

"Hello, senior."

He is definitely different. He doesn't seem nervous or fidgety like the other newcomers.

Based on my experience, these guys fall into two categories.

Either they have strong pride despite being insignificant, or they have confidence in their own abilities.

The guy in front of me right now belongs to the latter category.

"Excuse me, may I know your name?"

"My name is Kim Jin-su. I graduated top of the class in the 8th-grade training course. I was also the first one to destroy the Golem's core in the recent raid."

"Oh, really?"

"Yes. It was my first grade-Gate, but it wasn't as difficult as I thought."

He seems interesting.

He has a confident demeanor without being arrogant. He is someone who can take care of his own business wherever he goes.

When I glanced at him discreetly, Kim Jin-su smiled warmly.

"And feel free to speak comfortably, senior."

"It's our first meeting, so I'll be polite. Once we get more comfortable, I'll speak casually. It would be nice if we could skip the formal greetings like today, just like everyone else."

"Yes!"

"I will keep that in mind, senior!"

He doesn't even listen to me.

The noisy sound echoed through the corridor, and the office door at the end slid open.

In a neatly ironed white shirt and black slacks, there is only one hunter in our guild who comes to work in such attire.

"It's lively from the morning."

"It's too lively, which is a problem."

Team Leader Choi, holding a coffee cup, twitched inside the office like a scene from a sitcom.

"Let's settle down over a cup of coffee. Come in."

※ ※
The office was spacious and pleasant. It was adorned according to Team Leader Choi's taste, with luxury furniture scattered throughout, and a silver plaque on the desk.

"Even the plaque looks expensive."

With the Guild House relocation and the recruitment of new guild members, it must have cost a fortune. It seems true that Won Myeong-hoon, the guild master, received an astronomical amount of tribute money from the Star Guild.

As I admired the plaque, a cup of black coffee was suddenly pushed towards me.

When Team Leader Choi saw where my gaze was directed, he asked, "Shall I make one for you? A plaque."

"It's okay. I don't have any official position, so it's not necessary."

"You can create a position if you want. General team leader, head of the headquarters, whatever you say."

"Anything?"

"Then how about a small one like guild master?"

"It's just a joke. If I become the guild master, the guild will be ruined."

And besides, it's obvious that I'll just be a figurehead or a pants CEO.

I accepted the coffee cup and sat down on the sofa. There were over 20 newspapers piled up on the glass table.

From major domestic newspapers to overseas ones filled with incomprehensible characters. Just looking at them made my eyes spin.

"Do you really read all of this?"

"I check the international trends and gather industry information. It's not a big deal. I can read about five languages well enough."

That's actually quite impressive. Five languages? I wonder what kind of life this person has lived.

I sighed and skimmed through one of the newspapers that caught my eye.

A clear color photo of a man in his 30s and bold fonts caught my attention.

- Jeong Hyeon-woo, Hunter (photo attached)
- Continuing accidents. The death space that even high-level hunters can't avoid, the Gate.

- Myeongdong Guild, regret over an unexpected death of a member...

It seems another accident has occurred.

"Myeongdong Guild, that's Ji-hoon's guild."

As I was about to take a closer look, Team Leader Choi, elegantly tilting his coffee cup, spoke.

"The Peace Guild will continue to grow. We have already recruited over 20 hunters of Grade 8 and below. With this, our growth rate is unprecedented, even in the stagnant domestic market."

His words made the growth rate of the Peace Guild incredibly impressive.

In just about four months since the establishment of the guild, if this momentum continues, calling it a medium-sized guild would be an understatement.

"Of course, compared to medium-sized guilds, we still lack a significant number of affiliated hunters in terms of numbers."

"That's because we haven't recruited them yet, not because we can't. Just looking at the fact that our guild website crashed due to excessive traffic is enough evidence. We receive hundreds of job inquiries every day."

"And I played a significant role in that, you know, like my work and contributions."

"It's true."

Team Leader Choi gently replied.

"It is true, but we won't give you a bonus."

"You're quick to catch on."

I lightly teased, but as expected, he didn't fall for it.

He smiled at me without saying a word.

"But if you grant me one favor, I'll try to think positively."

"What favor?"

"Could you take care of the new guild members for a while?"

"... New recruits?"

"Yes. We went through the selection process and chose them, but they all have talent, although they still lack experience in many aspects."

"Of course. They're rookies."

No matter how much training they go through, the atmosphere in real battles is different from the training grounds.

It's not without reason that there's a saying that a lower-ranked hunter who has been in the field for ten years is lower than a top hunter who just finished graduation.

"But why me? Aren't there others?"

"I already mentioned it to Kim Jipsa and Song Yi this morning. They agreed to help train the new recruits."

"What did they say?"

"They accepted. Without any hesitation, they agreed wholeheartedly."

"... And what about King Jeong?"

"I haven't told him yet. It's well past the time to start work, but he hasn't answered any calls."

Team Leader Choi checked the time briefly and spoke again.

"It wouldn't be a bad idea. The new guild members also hope to be mentored by Jin Taekyeong. Most of them joined our guild because of him."

"Well, thanks for giving me a ride on the plane."

I sighed.

At this moment, the evil forces in the martial arts world have revealed themselves, and Jeokcheon is in a state of unconsciousness. Even if I spend 30 days here, time in the martial arts world flows only for three hours. I have plenty of time, but teaching children who are barely at the C-rank level is not a particularly worthwhile choice.

If that's the case, spending time with my family would be a hundred times better.

"I'll pass. It would be more efficient for the guild if I focus on breaking one more B-rank gate rather than teaching those brats."

"More efficient..."

"Yeah, efficiency."

"Well, I guess there's nothing to be done."

A wicked smile appeared on Team Leader Choi's lips.

"Please take care of our new guild members."

"Excuse me?"

"The B-rank gates. All the reservations are filled. There's no chance for at least the next week."

"Don't lie! You scammer!"

"If you don't believe me, go and see for yourself."

I snatched the paper that Team Leader Choi handed to me. The paper was filled with the current status of B-rank gate reservations nationwide.

Damn it, it's real.

"I'll give you a performance bonus of 200% this month. You can go on raids and teach the juniors. It's up to you."

"Or you can just stay at home and relax."

The corners of Team Leader Choi's mouth curved up in agreement.

"Cheers to a year!" Just as I was about to shout that, a system notification sounded.

Ding,
- Quest, [It Was Too Much Money to Say "No!"] has been created!
- Do you accept the quest?
> /Yes

"What will you do?"

"Assuming you accepted, I'll get the new recruits ready. We've already caught a few B-rank gates."

Ding.

- You have implicitly agreed.

- You have accepted the quest!

Damn it.

※ ※ Ga
Kreuk-ru-ru,
Conster's rough breathing closes in from all directions. Twenty pairs of uneasy eyes scanned the surroundings.

Hyowoo Hoowoo
That person's
Breathing became rapid, and their hand gripping the shield and weapon turned pale.

I sat perched on a high tree stump, silently observing the scene.

Though my expression was blank, my mind was filled with serious concerns.

"What should we have for dinner?"

Should we eat ribs, or should we have duck stew after a long time?

It's too wasteful to give up on both.
"Block!"

"What are the dealers doing? Dealers!"

At the scream, I suddenly looked and it was chaos.

A dozen or so Lycans charged, pounding the shield wall.

The exhausted tanks were pushed back one by one.

"They're getting overwhelmed because they're trying to face the monsters with strength alone."

Of course, it's not solely the tanks' fault. The dealers, too, are unable to fulfill their roles due to panic.

If they had executed suppression attacks at the right time, this situation wouldn't have happened.

I warned them several times before the raid started, but it's the same as always.

"That's about to collapse."

As soon as I thought that, with a scream, the shield wall crumbled.

In an instant, the space was surrounded. One Lycansrope, appearing the most agile, burst in with its distinctive roar.

The predatory eyes of the fierce beast turned toward the healers hiding behind the shield wall.

- Krrrrrrr!

- Awooooooo!

To me, it just sounds like dogs barking, but the rookies who have just started their second raid were terrified.

"Kaaaaaah!"

"Eeeeeek!"

The screams of the mages and healers shook the hidden forest.

As if it wasn't already noisy enough, hearing those sounds, another twenty will come rushing in.
I vividly remembered the two people who screamed.

From now on, those guys' nicknames are "Flute-playing Men."

"Senior! Senior Jin Taekyeong!"

"Please help us, senior!"

Several round faces looked in this direction, shouting desperately.

The front lines have already collapsed, and behind the rookies, there is only one enormous rock.

The Lycansropes were closing in with triumphant momentum, tightening their encirclement.

"How can monsters have better formation skills?"

I replied while flicking away an eyelash.

"I told you. If I help, your skills won't improve."

"It's okay if they don't improve!"

"I'm not okay with it. You know that, right?
When dependency becomes a habit, it also becomes a habit to take a shit during raids."

"But still... I don't want to die like this!"

"But... doesn't everyone dislike the idea of dying?"

"Please help!"

"Don't give up, keep fighting. Fighting!"

"Save me!"

"By the way, what should we have for dinner tonight, ribs or duck stew?"

"Hey, you bastard!"

It was the bald rookie I encountered in the morning.
The admiration-filled eyes that sparkled as much as his bald head were nowhere to be found, and his gaze was filled with saliva.

"Come down! This young punk..."

!

The bald rookie was flung away into the distance with a tanker that seemed to have come from somewhere.

The situation was already no different from the monsters' side. Should I step forward soon? I was contemplating when it happened.

Swoosh!

= Kawooooo...

With a flash, a Lycansrope let out a death cry. Blood gushed out from its pierced throat, and it collapsed immediately.

The young man who delivered an accurate and powerful blow shouted vigorously.

"Triple Formation!"

People regained their senses one by one at the loud shout.

Yeokgo. Twenty hunters equipped with large weaponry slowly began to move forward.

At the forefront was Kim Jinsu, the young man.

"Push harder! Archers, prepare your skills!"

That guy seems useful?

I smirked and jumped down from the tree. Then, I swung my spear towards the dozens of Lycansropes that rushed in response to the sound of battle.

Clang!

※ Phew

"You did well."

"Thank you, senior!"

Kim Jinsu smiled slightly and bowed his head. Three people were seen behind him, their heads bowed on the ground.

Two of them were the Flute-playing Men, and the remaining one was the bald rookie. The bald rookie received special treatment.

I should protect what I have, even if it's something small.
"Do the same next time. You've improved quickly."

"Yes, I won't disappoint you."

"Well, Jinsu, you should take a rest. There's another raid in two hours anyway."

Team Leader Choi was determined. To take on three raids in a day.

While contemplating that, my phone in my pocket vibrated.

[LuxuryBug]

What's this? Did telepathy work or something?

Perplexed, as soon as I answered the call, Team Leader Choi's urgent voice struck my ear.

- Tae-kyung, come to Ilsan Hospital right away!

Hospital?
