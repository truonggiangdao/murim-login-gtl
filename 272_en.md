- Hello?

The voice coming through the phone sounds unfamiliar.

The Park Ji-hoon I knew from middle school hadn't gone through puberty yet, and after that, we only had a brief conversation a few months ago.

Is this guy really him? It happened a while ago, so I couldn't quite remember.

- Is this Jin Tae-kyung's number?

"Oh, it's me. I wasn't sure if it might be someone else."

- What? Didn't you save my number last time?

"I did save it, but for a moment, I thought I might have dialed the wrong number. Your voice doesn't sound familiar."

- Well, it's been a long time since middle school, after all.

"That's true. I couldn't recognize you back then either."

- Of course not. How much money did you spend on your face?

I could hear a low laugh. There's a friendly atmosphere without any awkwardness.

I laugh along and get into the \10 limousine provided by the gate management office. The driver, who exchanges a glance with me through the rearview mirror, starts the car smoothly.

"So, what's up?"

- It's nothing special. I just called to see if you want to grab a drink.

"A drink? Out of the blue?"

- Well, we had a school reunion, so I thought I'd get in touch.

"Oh, did that happen?"

Now that I think about it, it seems like it did. But after that, I was so busy that I completely forgot about it.

- Unfortunately, something urgent came up at that time, and I had to go on a business trip abroad. That's why I couldn't attend the reunion.

"An overseas business trip?"

- Yeah, there were some issues with our European branch. I only returned recently.

I went to Moorim, and this guy went to Europe. I don't know what he did there, but for some reason, I feel a bit envious. I express my envy with a touch of bitterness.

"You lucky guy. Must have been nice to travel abroad, damn it."

- Jealous of me? You?

Park Ji-hoon laughs over the phone.

"It feels strange hearing that from you. Were you trying to play a prank on me just now?"

"Oh, no, it's not like that."

- I was joking. So, are you free today?

I quickly check the time and realize it's already late afternoon.

Since I moved out of my hometown to a studio apartment in Bucheon three days ago, the only person waiting for me at home would be my older brother, Jin-ho.

The time is fine, but the problem is... It couldn't be anything else, right?

However, my hesitation only lasts for a moment.

I've been working as a hunter for seven years. Even my closest friends from school, who were like brothers to me, gradually lost contact.

The saying that "out of sight, out of mind" isn't just true for romantic relationships.

But to doubt a friend who contacted me without any hidden agenda after such a long time...

"Have I become so distrustful?" It seems like I still carry the aftermath of the Won Myung-hoon incident. It leaves a sour taste in my mouth.

"You seem to be quite busy. Well, it's understandable. Then, maybe next time..."

"No, it's fine now. Where should we meet?"

A little while later, the limousine, smoothly crossing the road, changes direction.

"We arrived sooner than I thought."

Park Ji-hoon was already waiting outside when I arrived.

The weather was gradually turning into winter. His appearance, wearing a cashmere coat over a crisp white shirt, was in stark contrast to mine.

"What's up with the fancy outfit?"

"I have important business today. And let's talk properly. I didn't dress up, you dressed down."

"What's wrong with my outfit? Jeans and a sweatshirt would have been fine."

At least I made some effort with my attire. Ha-yeon kept nagging at me to stop wearing sweatpants.

"Where did all the money you earned go... Ah, right, you donated it."

"Don't bring that up. It still bothers me."

"That's why I called you. When you're bothered, alcohol is the best solution."

Park Ji-hoon smirked and shrugged. Then he started walking ahead.

After passing through well-dressed security guards and numerous surveillance cameras installed everywhere, we finally reached the entrance.

And I was left speechless at the sight that unfolded before me.

"What is this?"

The marble floor sparkled, and frames on the corridor walls displayed paintings reminiscent of the 17th century.

"I think I've seen those in an art textbook before. They can't be authentic, right? Yeah, they must not be. Acting all fancy."

I followed along, fidgeting like a country bumpkin.

At the spot where our steps halted, five elevators were lined up side by side.

There were no buttons, so I wondered what to do. But when that guy, Ji-hoon, placed his hand on a black panel, the elevator descended in the blink of an eye with mechanical sounds.

Ding.

"What are you doing? I'm not getting in."

"...Wow."

"Why are you so surprised?"

"Oh, it's just an apartment, right?"

"That's right. An apartment."

The apartment you know and the apartment I know seem quite different. I swallowed the words that almost slipped out.

Maybe because it's Cheongdam-dong, it exudes a luxurious vibe from the entrance.

"You've really succeeded. Buying a house in a place like this."

"A property was listed for sale recently, so I bought it. I sometimes drop by to clear my head."

Someone would think I bought a pair of shoes.

While sticking out my tongue, the elevator stopped, and the doors opened. Instead of a chilly and dark corridor, a living room adorned in gray tones stretched out before me.

I don't know the exact square footage, but the living room alone could rival my ancestral home.

"Come in."

Whether it was true that he occasionally came here to clear his head while shopping or not, one thing was certain: I had never seen a place like this before.

The large reception set and wine cellar installed in the living room felt like a high-end bar that had been directly transplanted.

Park Ji-hoon took off his coat and asked me.

"What do you want to drink?"

"What options do we have?"

"We have Ch창teau Cheval Blanc, Screaming Eagle Cabernet Sauvignon, Royal de Maria..."

What kind of language is that? With a flood of incomprehensible names, I blinked and asked.

"Ch창teau what? Sorry, what?"

"Ch창teau Cheval Blanc."

Whether it was Ch창teau or "what," I had no idea, but all the names were incredibly obscure.

Park Jihoon was waiting for me ahead of time.

The weather was gradually turning into winter. Your appearance, wearing a cashmere coat over a white shirt, was in stark contrast to mine.

"What's up? Why are you dressed up like this?"
"Well, I have an important appointment today. And let's talk properly. It's not that I dressed up, it's that you dressed casually."

"Hey, what's wrong with me! I could have just worn jeans and a hoodie."

At least you made an effort. Hayeon kept nagging me to stop wearing sweatpants.

"Where did all the money you earned go... Oh, right, you donated it."

"Don't bring that up. It hurts my pride."

"That's why I called you. When you're hurting, alcohol is the best."

Park Jihoon chuckled and motioned me to follow him. Then he started walking ahead.

After passing by well-dressed security guards and numerous surveillance cameras installed everywhere, we finally arrived at the entrance.

And when I saw the scene in front of me, my mouth dropped open.

"What is this?"

The marble floor shimmered, and paintings on the corridor walls exuded a 17th-century vibe, framed elegantly.

"I think I've seen those in an art textbook before. They can't be authentic, right? Yeah, they must not be."

I followed along, feeling somewhat out of place. Perhaps it was because of Cheongdam-dong, but even from the entrance, it exuded an affluent atmosphere.

"You've really made it big. Buying a house in a place like this."

"A property came up for sale recently, so I bought it. I occasionally drop by to clear my head."

If someone heard this, they would think I just bought a pair of shoes.

As I rolled my tongue, the elevator stopped, and the doors opened. Instead of a chilly and dim corridor, a living room adorned in gray tones stretched out before my eyes.

I'm not sure about the exact size, but it seemed as spacious as my ancestral home.

"Come in."

Whether it was true that he bought it to clear his head or not, one thing was certain: I had never been to a place like this before.

The grand reception set and wine cellar installed in the living room resembled a high-end bar, as if they had been directly transplanted from the 830.

Park Jihoon took off his coat and asked me, "What do you want to drink?"

"What options do we have?"

"We have Chateau Cheval Blanc, Screaming Eagle Cabernet Sauvignon, Royal de Maria..."

What is this gibberish? The names pouring out one after another made my eyes widen.

"Chateau Cheval Blanc."

Whether it was Chateau or Cheval, I didn't know, but all the names were incredibly unfamiliar.

"Hey, even though my memory isn't great, there's one thing I remember."

"The brain."

"You always copied my homework and got answers without doing any assignments whenever we had exams."

"Well, yeah."

"But with such a good memory, why were your test scores in memorization subjects so bad? I mean, did you even go to college... Oh, sorry, is it rude to ask?"

"Forget about being rude. I don't care."

"Well, that's fortunate."

"And I did go to college. Korean University, majoring in Business Administration. I haven't graduated yet because I suddenly had a change of heart."

"Oh, really? Korean University?"

"My parents wanted it."

"...Crazy. Are there parents who don't want their child to go to Korean University?"

Korean University is the best prestigious university in the country. Only the brightest students from all over the nation can get in. I looked at Park Jihoon with a puzzled expression, and he laughed playfully.

"It worked out. It wasn't as difficult as I thought."

"Um... As I hear more about his life story, it reminds me of the song 'Highway Star' by Deep Purple."

With a wealthy family and a brilliant mind, he instantly became a top student at the dream university everyone aspires to enter.

While I had to take responsibility for my livelihood, for him, being a Hunter was just one of many options.

"Why are you looking at me with a strange gaze?"

"You're giving yourself away."

"A lot. Taekyung, have you..."

Park Jihoon tilted his head slightly, resting his chin on his hand.

His voice, soaked in intoxication, trailed off.

"Are you jealous of me?"

Jealousy?

I was momentarily stunned by those unexpected words. Then, I burst into laughter.

"That's right. So, that's it."

"...To be honest. Longing for something you couldn't have? Envy, I guess. Well, I have no regrets. I lived my life to the fullest."

As if it was unexpected, Park Jihoon, with slightly enlarged pupils, muttered softly.

"You also envy someone."

"Hey, do you think I have nothing?"

"You do. Look at yourself now. A Hunter who garners attention not only in our country but also internationally. It won't be long before your name becomes known as one of the five Grade 5 Hunters in our country, a distinction held by only five individuals."

"That's impressive. Except for the fact that you're a trembling mess when it comes to donating."

I chuckled and emptied my glass. At that moment, the guy who had been silently observing me seemed like he wanted to say something.

Hmm.

The smartphone placed on the table vibrated. Park Jihoon pursed his lips as he looked at the screen.

"Who is it?"

"Our guild leader."

"At this hour? Does Myeongdong Guild have a 24-hour standby or something?"

"It's not about that. It's because of something important."

"Well, then..."

"Sorry. I think I should wrap it up here for today."

"I'm sorry, it's no big deal. We both understand each other's circumstances."

I put down my glass and stood up. With a face full of apologies, I nudged Park Ji-hoon's shoulder and said,

"It was nice to catch up after such a long time."

And I truly meant it. Now that he had become a famous figure in the modern world, it was rare to find someone with whom I could have a conversation without any ulterior motives.

I stopped the guy who was trying to get on the elevator with me.

"I'm leaving. Don't bother to see me off, just handle your work well."

A faint smile appeared on Park Ji-hoon's lips.

"Yeah, let's meet again next time. For sure."

With that final remark, the elevator doors closed.

Park Ji-hoon stood by the glass window, looking down below.

In the dimly lit streets, a person emerged from the entrance of the office building.

- Honey? Mr. Ji-hoon? 

"Speak."

- Ah, the call finally connected. I was listening to you, why didn't you say anything?

"Seems like our team leader is having some misunderstanding."

The dry voice caused the person on the other end to hesitate.

Park Ji-hoon raised the crystal glass to his lips and took a sip. Instead of the beer he was drinking earlier, it was now a deep amber whiskey.

"Next time, wait until I finish speaking. Don't awkwardly imitate a workplace boss."

Park Ji-hoon, Hunter from Team 1 of Myeongdong Guild.

That was Park Ji-hoon's affiliation written on the business card.

However, the team leader from Myeongdong Guild on the other end of the phone remained silent.

Both of them knew. That affiliation was nothing more than a hollow title.

"You're not answering."

"What's the matter? Is it about that important report?"

The team leader cautiously replied.

- Do you know Team Leader Jung Hyun-woo? He's in charge of Team 8.

"I know. He's skilled, but his adaptability is only half of his skill."

- It seems like he has caught a scent.

"Oh really? He's more perceptive than I thought."

- Yes. But I'm not sure what to do about it.

"Why are you even hesitating? Schedule a raid for the nearest date. Grade 4."

- Are you saying...

"Team leader, do you know how many gate accidents happen in a year? I don't. Neither do other people. No one cares."

Park Ji-hoon bit his tongue.

"But you're not giving me an answer."

- Ah, I understand.

"And regarding the Peace Guild, or rather Jin Tae-kyung..."

Park Ji-hoon trailed off.

The face of the person who had playfully tapped his shoulder appeared in his mind.

"It was nice to catch up after such a long time."

It was a sincere statement that could be felt. That's why it made it even harder to stop.

- Mr. Ji-hoon?

Park Ji-hoon took a sip of the remaining whiskey.

The crystal glass crumpled in his hand like a piece of paper.

"I finished talking with the higher-ups today."
"It was bothersome," they said.

That's all. A passing remark during the dinner with 'that person.' With that, the conversation was practically over.

- What? Huh. But now is a suitable time...

Park Ji-hoon's cold voice cut off the words of Team Leader 1, even though he was startled.

"Isn't it natural for a gardener to pull out weeds from the grass? I'm sure the guild leader on your side has already been informed. Let's end it here."

Click. The call was disconnected.

In the serene stillness, Park Ji-hoon stared at the clear window, observing the view outside.

Jin Tae-kyung's figure had long since disappeared.
