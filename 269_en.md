Walking alongside Ma Jong-hak, I felt the piercing gazes directed at us, filled with reverence and curiosity. Now everyone knows. Just a few days ago, the true identity of the young man who used to receive fortunate charity in a remote village corner was revealed to be the great martial artist known as Geomseong Ma Jong-hak.

"Isn't it? Geomseong Ma Jong-hak, the leader of the League."

"Wow, he looks so young. I thought he was just an ordinary wanderer."

"Indeed, Geomseong Ma Jong-hak has turned the martial arts world upside down."

Whispered conversations spread among the people.

"But who's the person next to him?"

"Isn't that Jin Tae-gyeong from Sanseo Jamryong? I heard from someone yesterday that Sanseo Jamryong was criticizing Geomseong Ma Jong-hak and trying to stop him."

"Wow, then it must be Gwangryong, not Sanseo Jamryong."

Damn it, I knew it. I pretended not to know.

When I glanced at the murmuring crowd, Ma Jong-hak chuckled.

"It's okay. Friends can have their differences, you know."

He really knows how to defuse a situation.

We moved to a secluded courtyard away from the crowd.

Although it was early spring, the weather was warm, and flowers were blooming. Ma Jong-hak, who was looking at some nameless flowers, spoke up.

"First, I want to thank you for what you did for Gomma."

"What did I do?"

"I heard that you provided great help to that child."

"What kind of help?"

"I don't know the details, but if he calls you a benefactor, you must have done something significant."

Even though I didn't know the details, I was curious to see how Ma Jong-hak would react if I mentioned the payment I received from Bingdang Lake.

"Actually, I was quite worried about that child. But seeing you now, I feel relieved. I owe you a debt of gratitude."

"Oh, I see."

I shouldn't mention Bingdang Lake. There's no need to provoke Geomseong by talking about the debt he supposedly owes.

"How is Cheong Sohye doing?"

"She's recovering enough to move around. As soon as she opened her eyes, she insisted on seeing you."

"Oh, really? So, what happened?"

"Well, she became quiet when I gave her some dumplings."

Parenting skills don't disappear after 20 years. Ma Jong-hak knows exactly how to handle Cheong Sohye.

"How about Jeok Daehyeob? How is he doing?"

"He still hasn't woken up. I'm considering other options."

"What about the doctor I sent? What did he say?"

"Ah, that person... He turned out to be a complete fraud."

"A fraud? Is he from Nakyang Goeui?"

"Something like that. I briefly looked into it, but now there's no way to get to him. So, what kind of fraud is he?"

Why is that old man so extraordinary? My frustration made me raise my voice.

Furious that he had caused such a scene by refusing to see Jeok Cheongang again, I had no choice but to let him go.

Ma Jong-hak sighed upon hearing the story.

"If he's related to Nakyang Goeui, he must be someone notorious in Jungwon. Eccentric as a nickname, but there's no doubt about his abilities."

"Is that so?"

I felt a sinking feeling in my chest as I watched Ma Jong-hak nod. It seemed like my thoughts were clearly visible on my face because he patted my back.

"Don't worry too much. If his life had been in danger, he wouldn't have just come back without any hesitation," he said reassuringly.

Although his words were comforting, my troubled heart didn't completely settle. Jeokcheon-gang, which I thought would quickly recover and stand up, had become a source of concern.

Over the past year, he had been my mentor, teaching me everything he knew, and in a way, he was like a grandfather to me.

"No, it should be nothing serious."

I suppressed the rising anxiety.

Many experts in the martial arts world had already examined Jeokcheon-gang's condition. Trusting their assessment was the best option at this point.

Having finished my thoughts, I changed the subject and asked, "Is there any new information about Amcheon?"

"Amcheon...," Ma Jong-hak looked at the flower garden with a strange expression.

"I just can't figure it out."

"What do you mean by that?"

Ma Jong-hak continued, "Ask yourself. Did anything seem strange about this incident?"

I pondered for a moment before opening my mouth.

"There are a few things that felt odd if I think about it."

"Like what?"

"First, I don't understand their intentions."

"Go on."

"If Amcheon intended to strike a blow to the martial world, they should have prepared a bigger attack. If their goal was to destroy the martial sects and seize control, they could have planted explosives or something similar. It would have been a perfect opportunity to eliminate the enemy's leadership, regardless of the success probability."

"But they sacrificed only Law King Gyeongdo and Sollim Temple. They clearly chose specific targets instead of openly revealing themselves and taking decisive action. It feels like they took an iron fist instead of a silver needle," I explained.

Ma Jong-hak, who had been listening quietly, suddenly spoke up.

"Don't underestimate them. They are people ruled by blood and power. They're no different from the Mago disciples during the Great Martial Arts War. It's impossible to grasp their true nature."

His words made my head spin.

"Secondly, it could be a smokescreen," I continued. "They wanted to destroy the symbol of the martial sects and leave their mark."

"A smokescreen?"

"Do you know who caused chaos in Sullim Temple?"

"Yumyang Twin Monks... Ah!"

"Yes, the Twin Monks. They were the High Masters who shook the martial world during the Great Martial Arts War. Even though many years have passed, there is still a possibility that they are still loyal to Mago."

Amcheon might be a chain link to Mago, or even a subsidiary organization, as Ma Jong-hak suggested. It was a possibility that couldn't be ignored.

However, there was one concern.

"Is the Blood Master also affiliated with Mago?"

"I don't know."

Ma Jong-hak answered without a moment's hesitation and fell silent.

"The Deadly Blood Martial Arts that you encountered and the attackers who raided Sullim Temple, as well as the Blood Master. They undoubtedly carry the scent of Mago, but there's something different. It's become even more mysterious and strange."

Ma Jong-hak, as a witness who had experienced the Great Martial Arts War firsthand, was an authority in the martial world. His words were practically the gospel in the field.

"Especially, the technique I saw at the end was something I had never experienced before," he concluded.

It's not a new martial art or spiritual cultivation technique, but rather a form of sorcery.

I've heard rumors about all sorts of bizarre sorcery in the Ma Sect, but I never imagined they were capable of something like this.

Even someone like me, who is familiar with magic, was left speechless and astounded.

"Isn't that almost like magic?" I thought to myself.

As a precaution, the disciples conducted thorough searches in the surrounding areas, but there was no trace of the Blood Master. It was as if they had vanished into thin air.

"If they can summon such a large number of enemies from anywhere...," I began to say, but the thought itself was terrifying.

The word "ambush" seemed trivial. If the enemies could appear out of thin air like Hong Gil-dong, it would be like being struck by lightning.

"I bet the higher-ups are in chaos," I thought to myself.

Even when I briefly attended the meeting the previous day, the atmosphere was already chaotic. It would only be worse now.

Lost in my own thoughts, I was suddenly interrupted.

"Have you ever thought about why they were so fixated on the Nokok Fire Staff?" Ma Jong-hak's piercing gaze was fixed on me.

"Because it's a sacred relic of Sollim Temple?" I suggested.

"It's more than just taking it away," he replied. "Honestly, I can't help but wonder what they would use it for."

As far as I remember, the Nokok Fire Staff was nothing more than a slightly special staff.

It only appeared more remarkable due to the authority of the Sollim Temple's leader and the thousand-year history of the temple itself.

It's not a staff made of bamboo, and taking away a fluorescent green staff, what could they possibly do with it?

"Yeah, that's a possibility too. Other people share similar opinions," Ma Jong-hak agreed.

With that statement, Ma Jong-hak, who had been lost in his thoughts, suddenly opened his mouth.

"Do you know that the Chief Guardian left me a letter?"

"No, I've never heard of it," I responded.

"He must have sensed his own fortune. In the letter, it was written that you were the sacred 'Limb' who will expel evil," he explained.

"You are truly a genius I have never seen before. Look around you. Is there anyone else at your age who has reached such a level?"

I pondered for a moment before daring to respond.

"Cheongpung."

"Ah, I see."

"He surpassed the pinnacle at the age of eighteen. I think you achieved something similar, didn't you?"

"At that time, I excelled in a different sense. I was given the nickname 'Ya-wang'," I replied.

"Ah, comparable to the Ten Kings. Is that what it means?"

"No, it's because I was too cunning."

"I see."

A chilly silence enveloped us.

Ma Jong-hak, who had been searching for words, chuckled softly.

"You really are my grandson."

"Well, I should be going now."

As I turned to leave, Ma Jong-hak's voice echoed behind me.

"I'll visit you again soon! I'll bring you some surprising news!"

Ah, he's always so quick.

"Have you returned?"

As I entered the room where Jokcheon River was lying, Hyeokmujin bowed his head and greeted me. Unlike before, his military bearing was noticeably tight, and I couldn't help but smile.

"That's right. Standing like that is part of your duty. Isn't it great that you can draw your sword at any time?"

"Of course. I will guard it like a steel wall."

"Well then, you can go."

"Farewell!"

Hyeokmujin swiftly left the room.

"Just make sure to take the gold nugget out of your sleeve and put it on the road."

"If you don't drop it by the count of three, you'll be executed today. One, two..."

Shaking.

Hyeokmujin, who had earlier exerted his strength to lower the gold mask, now weakly shook his head.

"Oh, you knew?"

"Do I look like a fool to you?"

"Please, Chief, I even went as far as borrowing money and taking out a loan... I'm at my wit's end."

He couldn't even afford it with 100,000 nyang, so he had to resort to borrowing money. He must be out of his mind.

I clicked my tongue and put the gold nugget in my arms.

"Watch what you're doing."

"I'll take a break from now on, so don't disturb anyone. Not even Big Brother."

"Even So Gaju, the military commander?"

"Yeah. Say he's exhausted and sleeping."

As I looked out the window, the gradually reddening sky caught my eye.

"The deadline is until tomorrow morning. Can you handle it?"

Hyeokmujin resolutely nodded.

"I'll dedicate my life to it."

"Well, since you won't sacrifice it anyway, just follow what I said."

"Farewell, Chief."

With a satisfied smile, Hyeokmujin left the room.

I quietly gazed at the seemingly sound asleep Jeokcheon River's face and then lay down on the adjacent bed.

"How long has it been?"

A year of nonstop running. Now, I longed to loosen the reins a bit and return to the embrace of my family.

"Log out."

Ding.

With the familiar notification sound, my vision faded to black.
