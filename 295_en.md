Armor flowing with vitality. An emerald green cloak fluttering like wings, and the hollow eye sockets glowing with a pulsating light.

And... it had a voice.

- 02 22 In Geun
The moment I heard its voice, reminiscent of iron being forged, I nearly fell off the tree.

"It spoke?"

This wasn't the first time something like this had happened. In the past, I encountered a Wyvern and the "One-Eyed Karus," both of which were able to communicate in a language.

However, for a monster to speak, it was not something that could be simply understood.

"A Named Monster..."

Unintentionally, a sigh escaped my lips.

That's right. According to what is known so far, only Named Monsters are capable of using language.

And right in front of my eyes, that Named Monster was born.

Or rather, it "evolved."

[4/.105 Skeleton Warlord]

Evolution. I had never heard or seen a Named Monster appear in this manner.

"No, this isn't some Digimon."
Was the monster really that monster? Did it really evolve?

Even I, who had drifted five hundred light-years away from an ordinary life, was bewildered. Not to mention the reactions of the other guild members.

"What's that?"

"Wait, didn't it just speak?"

"That's in the monster encyclopedia, of course."

Named Monsters are mutants. Each individual possesses different characteristics and varying levels of strength. Until they appear, no one knows anything about them.

"But why now?"
I pressed my dry lips together.

I didn't know the level of this Skeleton Warlord, but it undoubtedly possessed strength befitting a Named Monster.

"In addition, there are two Skeleton Knights, which are Grade ^ monsters."

The remaining 150 or so were all Grade # monsters, either Skeleton Mages or Warriors. They were practically a separate army on their own, and dealing with them was no easy task.

"But I've been raiding non-stop until now.

There are only fifty guild members inside the gate.

However, more than half of them are disciples who endured my whipping and underwent Hell Training.
In the past week, I fought skeletons to the point of exhaustion. If I calmly respond and handle the situation, I can handle twice or even three times our numbers.

Even the newly recruited rookies have exceptional basic abilities.

We recruited only the best as we offer salaries exceeding those of large guilds.

This time, I personally participated in interviews and various evaluations to assess their growth potential.

To withstand the storm called the Ares Guild, we chose only the finest saplings and transplanted them into the front yard of the Peace Guild.

"I'll have to accept some risks, but it's worth a try."

Team Leader Choi and the other three have suspended most guild operations and are solely focused on intensive training.

If they were here, the battle would have been much easier, but even if they were present, I wouldn't have deployed them.

The hidden dagger up my sleeve is lethal. I can't reveal it in a place where there are many eyes watching.

Having concluded my thoughts, I called out to one person.

"Jinsu!"

"Yeah!"

As Kim Jin-su, who was practically acting as the team leader, answered swiftly, I pointed my dagger towards the Skeleton Warlord.

Kim Jin-su, who was effectively serving as the deputy team leader, responded swiftly. I pointed my dagger at the Skeleton Warlord.

The sinister green glow in its empty eye sockets continued to glare at me.

"Hey, that's a named monster."

"Whoa!" A gasp escaped among the guild members.

Most of them were rookies who hadn't been hunters for more than two years. It was evident from their expressions that they were tense, facing a named monster that was rarely encountered even after spending 20 years in this field.

But Kim Jin-su was different. His surprise lasted only for a moment, and then he nodded calmly.

"I see."

"Haha, acting quite composed, huh?"

"To be honest, I'm a bit startled too, but that doesn't mean we should back down, right?"

Look at this guy.

From the beginning, I knew he had the guts, but showing such courage within just a year was impressive.

Perhaps sensing my determination, Kim Jin-su smiled wryly and added, "If it were a desperate situation, the senior would have given the retreat signal long ago, wouldn't they? My words make sense, don't they?"

Geez, this guy.

I smirked and tilted my head.

"You're right. This is a fight worth trying."

Choosing my words carefully, I continued, "I'll take those three over there. The rest is up to you guys. How long do you think you can hold on?"

After a brief thought, Kim Jin-su replied, "The newcomers who recently joined lack experience... but still, we can hold on for at least an hour."

"One hour?"

"Yes, at least one hour."

In that moment, when Kim Jin-su confidently and boldly answered, the Skeleton Warlord slowly opened its jaw and emitted an indescribable eerie sound.

- Beep!

- [4105 Skeleton Warlord] has used a special skill!

- Special skill, [Summon Undead], has been activated!

It was a bone-chilling roar, simultaneously a call awakening the cursed undead.

Thud, thud, thud!

The earth trembled as heaps of dusty skeletons rose and joined the formation, taking on their forms.

There were bone swords covered in dirt, wooden shields with scattered roots, and even mages wearing necklaces engraved with skull patterns among the Skeleton Warriors.

Even two Knight-class monsters had joined their ranks.

With the newly arrived reinforcements added to the existing Skeleton forces, their numbers exceeded an astonishing 300.

Silently observing the spectacle, I clenched my fists.

"Jin-su."

"Yeah?"

"Can you really endure for one hour?"

Kim Jin-su nodded with determination.

"Yes, senior. I can endure for one hour."

I let out a sigh. The Skeleton Warlord and its undead army were approaching us.

"Good. Let's hold on as long as we can for one hour and then retreat. Is everyone ready?"

The guild members tightened their grips on their weapons and nodded in response. Despite being rookies, they had honed their skills and were proficient in wielding their weapons. Speaking with confidence, I said, "Well done, everyone. Let's show our abilities in this fight and grow together!"

The guild members responded with determined expressions, nodding in agreement.

"Yes, Team Leader!"

I turned to Kim Jin-su for the final words.

"Jin-su, it's time for us to fight together. Your role is crucial, so lead us with your unwavering skills. I trust you."

Kim Jin-su smiled and replied, "Of course, Team Leader. I will do my best."

At that moment, the Skeleton Warlord charged toward us. The time for the decisive battle had begun.

"Tell me honestly."

"...I think we can hold on for about 30 minutes."

"Is that so?"

"Yes. The situation has worsened a bit, but I think we can manage."

Kim Jin-su looked at the Skeleton Warlord with a worried expression and spoke.

"If that bastard doesn't play any tricks."

"He probably will."

"No way."

- That b- b- b- bastard!
"Look, am I right?"

Kim Jin-su sighed.

"Oh, please."

Beep!

- [4105 Skeleton Warlord] has used a special skill!

- Special skill, [Commander's Resilience], has been activated!

- The strength, agility, and magic of the monsters under the command of the Skeleton Warlord have been enhanced!

- The enemy's momentum rises significantly!

The Skeleton Warlord roared!

The effect was tremendous!

"Wow."

Using [Insight], it was apparent that every single one of them had increased their level by 5.

The force with which over 300 Skeleton soldiers charged forward was beyond comparison to before.

I turned my head and saw Kim Jin-su, who seemed somewhat overwhelmed.

"Can you handle 30 minutes?"

This guy is now cursing me with his eyes.

Well, even I can see that it's impossible.

With a composed tongue, I gave the next order without hesitation.

"Slowly retreat. Don't provoke them."

"How far should we retreat?"

"To the narrow path right in front of the gate. So that we can escape at any time."

"Since the path is narrow, it will be easier to deal with the enemy."

As the deputy team leader suggested, the narrow path in front of the gate could barely accommodate five adult men side by side.

Even though they were relatively slim Skeletons, it was the limit for seven or eight of them to pass through.

However...

"Continue to retreat as planned."

There will be no head-on confrontation with them according to my revised plan.

"Understood?"

"Take the kids and go outside the gate."

Kim Jin-su's face was filled with confusion upon hearing my words.

"But what about you, Senior?"

"While you guys go, we'll be playing a game of tag. Someone has to buy us time."

"Senior! That's dangerous!"

"Jin-su, or should I say, dear members of the Peace Guild."

I looked down solemnly. Fifty guild members looked up at me, tilting their heads like baby birds.

"I, our Peace Guild, always prioritize the safety of our members."

Some of the older members murmured in agreement.

"Among the nonsense I've heard this year, that was the best."

"I felt like I almost died about seven times in the past week."

"About ten times for me."

On the other hand, the eyes of the rookies, who were only on their first day of work, trembled.

"Senior!"

"Oh, damn it!"

"For us, to go to such lengths for our sake...!"

I continued speaking with a determined voice.

"If it's for the safety of all of you, I am willing to take any risks. Even if my arms and legs are torn off! I will make sure to send you back into the arms of the people who love you!"

Some of them shouted with fervor.

"We can fight!"

"Please let us fight together."

I clenched my lips and lowered my head.

"That's not possible! In situations like this, where someone has to bear sacrifices, it is best for me to step forward!"

"But still...!"

Shiing! Seokeok!

Before someone could finish their sentence, a foreboding black aura flew towards us.

Flying high up, tens of meters above the ground, the Skeleton Warlord cut through the giant Adreth trees that stretched for hundreds of meters in circumference, and shouted with a resonating voice.

- Crush them all!

Thunk!

I jumped down from the tree, landing with a thud.

"Everyone, go back to the gate! I will handle the rear!"

This time, no one tried to stop me.

It was because over 300 Skeleton soldiers had started their advance.

The momentum of the monsters moving in unison, with their bones clattering and making a rhythmic sound, was overwhelmingly solemn.

The enhanced steps of the creatures strengthened by the Warlord's special skill overflowed with power, and faint light flickered from the Tulen skulls.

- 7969/0690/

As the Skeleton Knight, the deputy team leader, let out a war cry, rusted arrows and offensive magic soared from behind, heading towards the Peace Guild members.

Shh, shh, shh, shh! Whoosh!

"Block it!"

"Tanker! Don't lower your shield and slowly retreat!"

"Suppressive fire, engage!"

The distance between the two units was about three hundred paces. To safely retreat, we needed to create more distance.

I swung my sword, blocking the enemies at the forefront.

"These bastards! How dare they lay a hand on our precious Peace Guild members!"

Ssweaeaeak! Thud!

With force behind my spear, I shattered bones, and the blade that emerged from the transparent spearhead slashed in all directions.

At the moment when I took down ten of them in one blow, three Skeleton Knights attacked simultaneously.

- 79997
- 799970 //

Shiing!

Three strands of black aura narrowly grazed my body.

As blood trickled down from the wound on my neck, a mournful scream erupted among the guild members who had already retreated to the trail.

"Kyaa! Senior!"

"It's dangerous!"

I shouted with all my might, trying to break through the oppressive aura.

"Go! I'll catch up soon!"

"But...!"

"Jin-su! Go quickly!"

Kim Jin-su, who was hesitant until the end, led the guild members and shouted.

"You must come back!"

I smiled faintly and nodded.

"It's okay. Go!"

"Krgh!"

Kim Jin-su's figure disappeared beyond the gate.

Now, there were only hundreds of Skeletons and me standing on the trail.

- Eotrisugu7

Swoosh!

The Skeleton Warlord revealed itself through the gaps between the bones that split like the Honghai River.

- Jukgireunguoro-tgoin22

But I wasn't listening to its words.

I cautiously scanned my surroundings with the eyes of a hawk and finally let out a relieved sigh.

"Phew, they're finally gone."

- Yeoea2

"These kids are too sensitive. When the team leader tells them to go, they should just obediently run. What's the use of helping? Ain't that right?"

I wiped the blood dripping from my neck. I thought I had controlled it, but it cut deeper than I expected. About 0.2 centimeters?

"Ah, damn it. Such a waste of blood."

The warlord's golden eyes flickered uneasily.

- Nopetgat-wooseungutgut02

"Well, it's nothing special."

"Fill this narrow trail completely with the experience points, no, the Skeleton units," I muttered with a wicked smile.

"You all stay here. Just remember that."

- Bun Lo 2

Instead of answering, I took a deep breath.

The muscles throughout my body twitched, and as the power of the Dragon Flame surged through me, I moved swiftly in response.

And in the next moment, I unleashed the combined force of my hand and the spear.

Gwaahhhh!
