"니안
Team Leader Choi's face was undergoing a big and intense turmoil that I had never seen before.

Even Assistant Kim, who seemed relatively calm, was not much different.

Unseen anger and confusion. And doubt about my words.

"Could he have made such an expression?"

The two of them had always been the ones who calmly stepped back and resolved the situation whenever I boldly moved forward. 

Now, they finally seemed like people who were on the same side as me.

Feeling a strange inspiration, I opened my mouth.

"The answer is simple. If the enemies are strong, we just have to become stronger."

"Mr. Jintae-kyung."

Team Leader Choi's voice was quiet and steady. He had regained his composure and returned to his usual calm demeanor.

"This is not a math problem that can be solved by simply understanding it. To reach the answer, we have to go through a process that is unimaginably difficult."

"Well, that's fine. Even if it takes time, I think I can solve it if I take on the role of a tutor. Oh, let's change the subject though. I hate math."

"Have you forgotten? They are the Ares Guild. Mr. Jintae-kyung may not know, but I do. I know how strong they are."

"Unfortunately, what Lord Doyeon said is true."

With those words, Team Leader Choi and Assistant Kim fell silent.

One is the great-grandson of Ares Guild Leader Cheon Tae-min, and the other is a key figure who has long been in his service.

Considering their positions, they must have seen and experienced many things firsthand. Unlike a passionate heart, their cold and calculating minds have already calculated the answer. But...

"Team Leader Choi."

Looking into his eyes, where the period was already marked, I asked.

"Of course."

"What did you say to me before we went to the Myeongdong Guild? Do you remember?"

Team Leader Choi, who had been silent for a moment, moved his lips.

"Mr. Jintae-kyung may seem reckless at first glance..."

"He always anticipates the worst situations and acts. And?"

"He always brings the best possible outcome."

"Do you really trust me more than yourself, Team Leader Choi? Was that just something you said to make me feel good?"

"That is definitely not true."

"I may not be good at studying, but I'm not foolish enough to risk my life in a game with zero possibility. That... is worth doing."

"Worth doing..."

"Team Leader Choi, if you can't trust yourself, then trust me."

In his eyes, I could see a glimmer of light. Though faint, the essence of that light was hope.

Hope is like a spark. It can ignite and extinguish in an instant. We need to fan the spark before it goes out.

"Now that the words are out, let me ask you this. If I leave the guild here, will Team Leader Choi give up too? Well, it wouldn't be bad to retire and start farming with Assistant Kim. And if that happens, Jeong Ae-jussi and Song-i will support us with fertilizer."

"Mr. Jintae-kyung!"

Ignoring Assistant Kim, who was trying to block me, I continued speaking.

"You said you wanted to create the world's greatest guild. If I leave, and Jeong-ahjussi and Song-i leave too, will you still fight against the Ares Guild?"

"Team Leader Choi."

No response. There was no answer.

However, the spark that had seeped into his eyes was still alive.

Then, a voice escaped from his lips.

"Ares Guild is an empire. Even if the

 top 10 domestic guilds join forces, they cannot withstand the power of that empire."

"Well, we just have to work diligently to catch up with those guys."

"While also understanding the enemy well. That's why it's even more dangerous."

"At the same time, the possibility has increased. You're saying that because you're good at understanding the opponents. That means the chances are higher, right?"

"After thinking about it several times, it seemed impossible in my calculations."

"Then, calculate it again."

"Really... Is it possible?"

"Where did I make a mistake in my calculation? What exactly gave you the confidence in Mr. Jin Tae-kyung's answer?"

I don't ask because I didn't understand. Team Leader Choi wishes more than anyone for his answer to be wrong. He wants a chance to challenge Lee Jeong-ryong.

I willingly answered his request.

"The person I'm currently discussing with Team Leader."

Suddenly, I raised my finger and pointed to my chest.

"Right here."

At that moment, Team Leader Choi's pupils trembled. I felt the ember that had been smoldering within him extinguishing.

What filled the vacant space was not hope but disappointment.

"My calculation included Mr. Jin Tae-kyung."

"Of course. If I know Team Leader Choi well enough."

Team Leader Choi is a sharp individual. He possesses exceptional vision and drive, born from innate leadership.

With a composed mind, he would have weighed the Peace Guild and the Ares Guild, and I would have been part of the weight carried by the Peace Guild.

"Until now, Mr. Jin Tae-kyung's performance has always been astonishing. No, it has been marvelous."

I already know what words will follow behind his fading voice.

"But is it not enough?"

Team Leader Choi nodded heavily.

"Apart from Lee Jeong-ryong, a Rank 5 Hunter, the Ares Guild officially includes over a hundred Rank 2 Hunters. Not to mention the numerous intermediate and lower-ranked Hunters."

Team Leader Choi emphasizes the word "officially," indicating that there are undisclosed forces at play.

"Yet, the Ares Guild alone has over a hundred Rank 2 Hunters."

I already knew this fact from rumors, but hearing it directly from Team Leader Choi made me truly grasp the power held by the Ares Guild.

No matter how strong I may be, in the end, it is just one hand. Therefore, Team Leader Choi's judgment was rational.

However...

"If that's the case, shouldn't you recalculate?"

"What?"

"The formula is correct, but the numbers are wrong. I don't know the exact value you assigned to me, but at the very least, it should be several times higher."

Team Leader Choi, as well as Kim Jipsa, Im Jeong, and Song Songyi, widened their eyes.

Considering everything I have accomplished so far, it is a reasonable request.

I left behind the people who were frozen like statues and stared at Team Leader Choi.

"It seems like what Nunu said was right. I'm a person with more secrets than you imagine."

The martial world is the martial world, and the modern world is the modern world.

In my mind, there was a clear boundary separating the two worlds. However, Lee Jeong-ryong and the Ares Guild erased that line.

Perhaps, if it weren't for this recent incident, I would have kept that secret to myself for the rest of my life.

"Was it too ambitious of me to want to live quietly?"

Maybe this is the destiny bestowed upon me by the power. So now, I must accept it. I cannot continue to be a victim forever.

To protect the precious things from enemies, I must become stronger.

"Well, what will you do now?"

Team Leader Choi still looked at me with an expression of disbelief.

"Mr. Jin Tae-kyung, you always manage to surprise me."

"Don't be too surprised. There will be more of that in the future."

"It will be a dangerous path."

"I am a specialist in thorny paths."

"It will be incomparable to anything you've faced before."

"What's the point of comparing? It's already hell on this side~~…"

It seems like he took my words as a joke.

I finally looked at Team Leader Choi, who had a smirk on his face.

"Team Leader."

"Yes?"

"It's okay to be honest sometimes too."

"Choi Team Leader's laughter that was tied to his lips disappeared. His gaze settled, and his mouth remained slightly open.

I waited for him to speak.
I needed to hear the words directly from Choi Team Leader's mouth.

Fortunately, the wait wasn't too long.

"It's an unexpected request, but will you continue to stay with the Peace Guild?"

That's it.

I smiled and tapped Choi Team Leader's shoulder. Despite appearing intelligent and composed on the surface, he was still vulnerable inside.

In his heart, he wanted to stay together, but he also wanted to send us away, fearing that we might get hurt.

"Let's do well together."

"Understood."

Choi Team Leader, who appeared to be smiling, turned towards the others.

First to speak was Kim Jipsa, who was both a colleague and a close friend.

"I believe you already know my answer."

"Thank you, Kim Jipsa."

Next was Song Songyi. After receiving the same question from Choi Team Leader, she sighed deeply and spoke.

"The Ares Guild, huh? Well, that doesn't quite add up."

In truth, this is the most normal reaction. It would be strange to welcome someone openly declaring war against the Ares Guild.

"Please adjust my salary to match the situation. And also, hazard pay."

Song Songyi wasn't normal either.

When I looked at her with a bewildered expression, she shrugged her shoulders.

"Well, what?"

"Oh, nothing. Usually, in a situation like this, people would just leave, right?"

"Do you want to leave?"

"Ah, absolutely not."

"I wonder why I moved from the Ares Guild to the Peace Guild? Even if you gave me double the salary."

"I thought my goal was to retire at thirty. If I earn enough in the remaining two years, I can live comfortably for the rest of my life."

She spoke casually, but it was just a roundabout way of saying that she wanted to stay. Everyone knows that the thrifty Song Songyi has already accumulated a substantial fortune.

"And, well, it seems like you have your own motives, so I'll believe in you for now. It's not easy to meet a superior like Choi Team Leader, who is talented and handsome."

Whether it was true or not, Song Songyi's decision to stay was now confirmed. The gaze of everyone in the room turned towards the last person.

"Are you worried, Ahjussi?"

He didn't respond to my call immediately. After a while, he clenched his lips.

"Taekyung, can I be of any help?"

"Absolutely."

"Even though I'm just a mere Rank 17 Hunter?"

"The people related to the L are the real protagonists. By the way, how about changing your name? What do you think of Lim 1). Jeong?"

Eokjeong, who had been laughing out loud, looked straight at Choi Team Leader.

"It wasn't Choi Team Leader's fault that I got injured. So don't blame yourself."

"No, it's not your fault. It's my fault. Everyone, please focus on your recovery and rehabilitation first. Hunter Lim, don't you have a family?"

"Yes?"

"When my arm was first cut off, do you know what I thought of first?"

"Your family?"

I'm a husband to one woman and a father to two children.

However, Lim Jeong-ryong calmly shook his head.

"Oh, I can't be a Hunter anymore. That's what I thought."

My heart fluttered at that sight. While people treated him as a mere low-ranking hunter, Lim Jeong-ryong was truly a rare hunter of this era.

"They are all too valuable to stop here.

Alright, let's get rid of the horn while we're at it."

With a firm resolution, I opened the skill window, which I hadn't touched in a long time.

And within the densely written hologram window, I found what I was looking for.

Skill: [Secret Technique Creation]

Yes, now it begins.

With a resolute determination, I touched the hologram window.

Beep!

- To create a secret technique, a minimum of 4 scrolls and 300 sheets of paper are required!

What the hell?
