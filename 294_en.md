A week ago, Team Leader Choi successfully obtained everything he wanted after persistent negotiations with Lee Jeong-ryong's side.

This included exclusive rights to over twenty gates, real estate, and a substantial amount of cash. Although I don't know the exact amount, its value was undoubtedly astronomical.

Having a team of over ten Black Hunters and the assistance of Myeongdong Guild's Park Tae-seop and his subordinates, we obtained valuable loot that we wouldn't have acquired otherwise.

"It's the same here."

I energetically attached the guide rail and was the first to pass through the mana barrier.

Squish. It was sticky and unpleasant, yet I felt the familiar sensation of mana, and everything around me changed.

Ding.

- Entered Grade 4 Gate: [Black Forest of the Black Mage]!
- Quest: [Gate Conquest] has been automatically generated!

"Left foot, left foot! One, two, three, four! Stand in position!"

"Hanat, dool! Formation!"

With sharp and synchronized shouts, the human train came to a halt when over fifty people had already entered the gate.

A dim moonlight shone through the dense forest and twisted branches.

The new recruits, who belatedly realized the situation, looked around with perplexed faces.

"We're doomed."

"Wait, what grade gate is this? Why is it so vast?"

In contrast, the reactions of the third-week disciples were nonchalant.

"Another Black Forest of the Black Mage?"

"Oh, I can't believe it."

"Good thing I brought my hammer."

Although they had joined less than a month ago, the difference was evident.

On the other hand, the first-day recruits, overhearing the conversation of the disciples, turned pale.

"Ho, Black Forest of the Black Mage?"

"It's a high-level gate!"

Grade 4 Gate, Black Forest of the Black Mage.

Even those who didn't know much about this place could sense the atmosphere just by hearing its name. A spooky forest that made one shudder merely by looking at it.

This place was ruled by the Black Mage, a necromancer.

"Sir Sibal! Senior Jin Tae-kyung!"

One of the tankers ran up with an anxious expression.

"Could you please let me go? I'm really scared of ghosts. I'm okay with regular monsters, but ghouls and skeletons are just unbearable."

"Trauma?"

"Not to that extent, but they terrify me."

"Well, this might be a good chance for you to experience it at a level 40 feeling. After all, dogs are also monsters."

"No, it's just..."

"And on our guild application, there was no mention of such a problem, right?"

"That's because I wanted to pass... Please, my girlfriend can't even watch horror movies."

"Oh, your girlfriend. I understand. Here!"

I flicked my finger, and amidst the smiling disciples, one person sprang out like a bullet.

"Did you call for me?"

Among the disciples, there was Kim Jin-su, who quietly played the role of a second-in-command.

He had decent leadership skills and exceptional combat abilities, always fulfilling the role of my right-hand man during raids.

Ah, I should have mentioned it earlier.

"It's not for nothing; I have separate instructions for you. This person here."

I pointed towards someone.

"Place him at the forefront."

Jin-su heaved a sigh of relief, took a deep breath, and swallowed it.

"Th-the forefront? Did you just say the forefront?"

"Why? Is there a problem? Judging by the tower shield you're holding, your position is clearly that of a tanker."

"But..."

"If you want to leave, feel free to do so. Just be prepared to face termination."

"T-te-termi...nation?"

"Why would I hire someone who refuses raids because they're scared of ghosts? And are there ghosts in the gate? They're all monsters. Jin-su, am I wrong?"

Jin-su confidently replied, "You're absolutely right."

"If all the people here were ghosts, why would I bring hunters? I would have brought exorcists. Isn't that right, Jin-su?"

"Absolutely, sir."

"Jin-su, you always have a way with words."

"Thank you."

"So, would the person standing there like to continue being a peace guild hunter, or would they prefer to be terminated and switch to being an exorcist?"

The tanker replied with a firm expression on their face, "I-I will continue as a hunter."

"Alright, if you try to flee during combat, I'll personally send you to heaven. Okay?"

"O-Okay."

"Okay. Forefront! Okay! Heaven!"

As I extended my hand, Jin-su grabbed onto his arm and pulled him away towards somewhere.

Despite going through a meticulous selection process, there always seemed to be one of those individuals who managed to squeeze their way in wherever you went.

"What? Scared of ghosts to the point where you can't even watch horror movies with your girlfriend?"

Sigh. What nonsense.

It wasn't that I was angry because he had a girlfriend. It was true.

Whooong.

A chilly breeze rustled through the forest, causing a shiver to run down my side. I took a step forward towards the trembling forest.

As I walked away, the fading sound of their conversation reached my ears.

"U-Um, excuse me, sir."

The voice of a frightened tanker.

And the resolute reply from a disciple intersected.

"Why?"

"Where are you going, Hunter Jin Tae-gyeong?"

"I'm going on a targeted hunt."

"What?!"

"That person's nickname is the Flute-playing Man."

The disciple added with a pleased voice, "I can't be the only one suffering. Let's do well together."

※ ※ As if urging them to listen, a loud noise echoed through the forest, and soon the effects became apparent.

Pershoo! Googoo-gung.

- Goo99707 /
- 20,7700 0...
Thud, thud, thud!

With grotesque screams, corpses that had been sleeping in the ground awakened.

Ghouls shedding rotten flesh, skeletons revealing nothing but pale white bones.

Undead monsters (0006309 14005868), cursed spirits, quickly covered the forest and hills.

"Hey, slowly follow me! Got it?"

- Goo99099 /
Tat-tat-tat-tat!

Zombies dragging their bodies along with a limp gait now seemed like fallen chickens.

Sometimes, seeing them run, I couldn't help but think they were from the Taerung Athletes' Village. But of course, they were no match for me.

"Today, since we have new recruits, let's take it a bit easier.

I soared through the air, occasionally glancing back and checking the numbers.

About fifty or so, roughly?

It was a number three times that of our allies, but even that seemed fewer than usual.

After all, ghouls and skeletons weren't particularly powerful monsters, and we had prepared thoroughly and had confidence in ourselves.

"It's not for nothing that they call us disciples.

We brought three times the basics, and occasionally, even ten times the number, to show these kids the threshold of hell.

Of course, if it seemed truly dangerous, I would step in from time to time, and thanks to that, we had injuries but no fatalities.

By repeating this several times a day, I became both a public enemy and a trusted figure.

"I didn't want it to come to this... but there's no other choice."

This is an attribute tutoring. I must plant the weeds that survive in harsh environments in the yard of the Peace Guild as soon as possible.

In less than a month, several people have already declared their resignation and moved to other teams. I didn't hold them back, nor did I have any regrets.

"The decision is theirs; everyone has their own life. I only briefly intervened in their lives.

I can offer options, but I have no right to force a choice.

Sssaaaack!

"The Black Forest of the Dark Magician" boasted a vast size, designed to serve as a rapid gate.

However, the part I explored was only a small fraction of it. As I adjusted my speed and ran, the gate's outline soon came into view.

"They're coming!"

"Jin Tae-gyeong, you bastard..."

"But I guess it's a bit fewer since it's our first time."

"Damn it, Skeleton!"

From the person loudly announcing the appearance of monsters to those cursing me or calmly assessing the enemy's numbers, the inexperienced ones who had no combat experience seemed visibly shaken.

Of course, the human disciples who received harsh training from me couldn't just stand there idly.

"What the hell are you doing over there! Line up!"

"Don't take a step back. Grip your shields tightly. What? Do you need to pee? Then go ahead and pee!"

"Newcomers, get your heads straight. Jin Tae-gyeong will never help you. The Guild Foundation was created in anticipation of people dying here."

This really belittles people to the extreme.

It was unbelievable, but I endured it. Yes, to make these kids snap out of their daze, I had to go to that extent.

"People curse even the king in a place like this..."

Of course, I remembered all their faces.

As I got closer to the hunters who were already forming a large formation, I climbed up the tallest tree and shouted.

"Shield formation!"

Kugugung!

Flawless movements. Undead monsters, who used to watch from the dark trees like chickens chasing a dog, turned their gruesome faces.

One of the skeletons, who had spotted the fifty hunters forming their ranks on the hill where the gate entrance was located, swung its bone sword and let out a terrifying scream.

- Geu9999897 /
This is no ordinary skeleton.

The bones that should be exposed were wrapped in a fishnet armor, and the bone sword swung with a force that surpassed the night sky, surrounded by a sinister black aura that blazed like a raging fire.

"Skeleton Knight (96000 42800)?"

They are not of the same class just because they have the same skeletal structure.

Skeleton Soldier, Mage, Warrior... Each individual has unique abilities and varying levels of strength, and Skeleton Knights are recognized as powerful monsters in their own right.

"I've encountered them often in the Black Forest... but that one is different."

Encountering a Skeleton Knight, a class & monster of the same rank at the urgent gate, was only natural. These guys were scattered throughout the Black Forest, commanding lower-ranked Warriors and Mages.

It was at that moment, as I narrowed my eyes and observed the creature.

- 79790
- 7YuYuYoon /
Tsu-tsu-tsu-chi

Followed by a resounding roar and the radiating aura of two lines.

I murmured in a voice mixed with astonishment.

"...Three Skeleton Knights in one group?"

This is something I've never seen before.

The group of Skeletons forms a single army, with the Knight being the leader of that army. In this independent army, there is only one commander.

However, my expectations were completely off.

When the two new Knights appeared, their bones rattling, they approached the first Skeleton Knight and knelt down, placing their bone swords in the ground.

This was a clear gesture of obedience, and their eye sockets glowed brightly.

Whoosh!
A burst of bright light erupted from the darkness, dazzling our eyes.

In that fleeting moment when our gazes met, the creature transformed into blazing flames.

- Geuwoo9997
Card-d-dook!

With a mighty roar, its body underwent a transformation. Its bones curved and elongated, and an unknown black sheen covered its surface.

But the transformation didn't stop there.

Crackle!

The rusty and broken armor scattered on its body seemed to rewind time as it magically repaired itself. Broken chains were reconnected, and the faded skull pattern on its chest regained its vivid colors.

Finally, an emerald green cloak billowed in the wind.

The creature, having completed all these changes, stared intently at its palm.

Instead of pure white bones, a hand adorned with sturdy gauntlets was there.

And in the next moment...

- 400ji Eun Gun
Ssuaaaikji
The air around the forest trembled.

All of us, including myself, were left speechless as we stared at the creature in awe.

Skeleton Knight, once a noble and valiant knight, had now transformed into something different.

[4/.105 Skeleton Warlord]

- 40 92 In Geun
The gleaming light locked its gaze on me.
