Beep!

- [4/.105 Skeleton Warlord] has used a special skill!

- The special skill, [Summon Undead], has been activated!

- The slumbering undead respond to the commander's call!

Ah, it's so relaxing like this.

Whenever I see the skeletons rising up like sprouting bean sprouts, a sense of happiness fills a corner of my heart.

"Is this the true heart of a farmer:
A bountiful harvest indeed. It's a year of abundance."

With a bright smile, I lower myself, or rather, swing my scythe and begin the harvest.

And every time I shatter the skulls of the newly awakened skeletons, a beautiful sound resonates and spreads.

Ding. Ding. Ding.

- [4.71 Skeleton Warrior] has been defeated.
- You've gained a small amount of experience!

- [470 Skeleton Archer] has been defeated.
- You've gained a small amount of experience!

The Skeleton Warlord, who now rewards his subordinates with experience, murmurs with a melancholic voice.

- 998, the true strength lies in unwavering loyalty.

Just as I was about to swing my spear towards the next enemy, I suddenly stopped.

"What did you just say?"

- 290, behold.

The hesitant figure opens its eyes and confronts me. It seemed as if the fear of being annihilated had replaced the previous rage, as if the fear of obliteration within the great legion of the undead had been awakened.

- "Should I let you be destroyed or not? That's for me to decide. But before that, repeat what you said earlier."

"By the way, you have a peculiar skill. Something like the commander's rubber or whatnot."

- 7 goals in height, "Ah, right. How could I forget?
I missed that."

I smiled brightly and affectionately stroked the Warlord's skull.

"Use that."

The Warlord responded with a genuinely perplexed voice, "I don't really understand."

"Why did you lose Mama? That damned bastard with his foolish pranks. Should I just make him disappear?"

Rustle.

When I exerted strength in the hand holding his head, the Skeleton Warlord urgently shouted.

"Lord. I see one now."

-
“So do it or not.”

The Warlord's green pupils moved uneasily from side to side.

The guy who showed quite a variety of emotional expressions on the subject of the skull gave a difficult answer shortly after.

He was told to stop the senseless and savage slaughter of monsters and no one else. For a moment, his head was spinning.

“Are you insane? That's what a monster bastard would say?"

“Then you shouldn't talk about knights either.
This kid is the one who hits the goal."

Still, it's a named monster, so it's definitely different from other monsters that scream out loud because they're possessed by instinct.

'Anyway, it's a contract.'

I pondered and finally opened my mouth.

"good. decided."

He continued talking while looking at the green eyes that fluctuated as if he was embarrassed.

See how generously he spreads that he is not going to perish.
At this level, they are not puppets, but roaring puppets.

As I looked at it with a puzzled expression, the world's first pro-popular (Haes0) named monster, Skeleton Warlord, quickly memorized a spell.

- 298 Gon 2
Beep!

- [/.105 Skeleton Warlord] has used a special skill!

- The special skill, [Commander's Rubber] has been activated!
- The strength, agility, and magic of the monsters under the command of the Skeleton Warlord have been enhanced!

- The enemies' levels have increased by 5!

...Now, I can handle things on my own.

*※.: N/A
The harvest work was easy.

Once is difficult, but if you repeat it two or three times, you'll get the hang of it.

The Skeleton Warlord quickly utilized the commander's abilities to efficiently replenish his forces.

- Army 80/and Call 90/
Creak, rattle!

Hundreds of newly grown skeletons gathered in one place. Just by scattering spears towards the gathered ones according to orders, experience points poured in abundantly.

Slash! Flash!

Ding. Ting. Ding.

The corners of the Warlord's mouth lifted as experience points were deposited. He murmured in a satisfied voice while watching that scene.
- Om "/297# Strong and efficient.

- 29/Did you see that bastard?

Seeing his satisfied look as he found an efficient method of tribute collection, it seemed like I knew why his soul had become corrupt.

If the wind of liberation blows in the Black Forest, the skeleton soldiers of the resistance should be their top priority target for subjugation.

"It feels like I've become the invader myself."

I started collecting loot with a strange feeling.

Skeletons are representative scavenger monsters. The things they produce are either rusted weapons that cause tetanus or half-decayed bones.

They say that even if you boil a minotaur's corpse, it only produces beef bone broth, and that thing tastes like a grave.

"Oh, a mask and armor."

Only the Skeleton Knights that occasionally appear in groups leave behind well-preserved masks and plausible equipment, one or two at a time.

Of course, that happened by chance as well, but "With this size, it would easily cost tens of millions of won."

It was a good decision to send out guild members. Not only did we gain experience points, but we also devoured the masks.

The Warlord asked me with a mischievous smile as I grabbed a single mask with an adult-sized fist.

"Can't you see? I'm collecting the wages of labor."

"You talk about absorption. Naturally, you should sell it."

"That's what monsters like you do. Humans are different."

It's a well-known fact that monsters' enemies are not only humans.

There were cases of them fighting among themselves, and in the process, there were also cases of them devouring enemy monsters to gain strength.

- 7272? 02972 Into 7,227: You're in the middle of that number, so it must be good to have a retreat... it's called Nong.

"It's necessary for a good life. Besides, humans can't absorb a mask anyway."

The Warlord wiggled his skull as if to agree when I explained it roughly.

"Oh, a potion? That goes through a purification process and then..."

- 0 4 Jung 0820 Into the 9292 Hideout? It's a drone that Komseon called for 022.
"If it were that simple, I would have purified it a

 long time ago. Anyway, it's just because it might be a monster."

If the troll's blood is a fruit-flavored drink with 1% added fruit scent, then a mask is 100% fresh fruit juice.

Since the poison of the mask cannot be completely eliminated, I absorbed the mask.

I chuckled and said.

"Anyway, humans can't absorb the magic stones."

- 9?

"Stop asking. This question mark is a damn killer. It's a well-known theory in the academic world. Haven't heard or seen anything like that."

- Also, into the 2097 end of the Gondu pier flower
I stopped as I was about to strike the Warlord's skull.

Wait a minute. This actually makes sense.

"There's no need to be trapped by common sense."

Aren't I myself an existence beyond common sense?

The so-called academic theory is nothing more than results derived within the known scope.

"The mana cultivation method is the same."

Those who know about that existence are a tiny minority.

Until I got involved with the Ares Guild, I never even thought about it.

Before and after monsters appeared, their own league remained unchanged, and secrets were shared within the fences they set.

"Absorbing magic stones...."

Should I give it a try?

As I was about to open my inventory to take out the magic stone again, the Warlord spoke up.

- After-effects of a single blow are regulated, you stupid idiot.
"Oh. Give a disappearing punch to the skull?"

- ...3 Take 9
"You apologized within 3 seconds, so I'll acknowledge it."

The Skeleton Warlord muttered, having avoided destruction according to the national rule.

- With 9 forces & the 78 gold can you please break it down into 0 rows?
"If I had seized the Black Forest as the leader of the Skeleton Knights in a coup, I would have made a name for myself."

- 9/The Warlord 97 is in the middle of the troops/9/
"The commander of the Undead Legion. Yeah, now I'll settle comfortably."

I only found out later that the bastard had taken over the Black Forest.

It seemed that by absorbing the magic stones, the Skeleton Warlord, who was practically no different from a master, was defeated. It must have absorbed a tremendous amount of magic power.

"This is a complete victory for humans, or rather, skeletons. A mere Skeleton Knight becoming the master of the Black Forest, evolving into a Warlord. If that's the case, the magic stone it absorbed from the dark sorcerer must have been enormous."

- What kind of nonsense are you talking about? The 902nd law is self-evident.
Three/
- Moreover, the dark sorcerer was the one who summoned me directly. So, until recently, his orders were absolute. As a summoned being, I couldn't defy the summoner's command.

"But how did it happen..."

- You don't have to understand. Just know that it happened.
The green glow in the Skeleton Warlord's eyes narrowed.

- That 90# is the 47th rule of the Golden Coromon Cool and Frozen - the 29th commandment is forbidden - the 75th post of the 22nd rule, the 90th summoner, is the 8920th magic. Only 2% of them are real.
"Suddenly?"

- I have no idea what you're talking about. It tastes like 22997 and 298.
What is this nonsense?

However, like the Warlord said, the creature itself couldn't properly explain what it had experienced.

After much contemplation, it added a single sentence.

- 9/ You must see the plea)Gollan 7/ person.
"Does the skeleton have something to say?"

That damn skeleton might be right.

It was the moment when I stared at the Warlord with a cold expression.

- What?

The Warlord's skull rolled back and forth above its neck, then stopped moving in one direction.

The creature, with its green glow shining, looked south, gritting its jawbone and spoke.

- It's you.

"Intruder?"

- Among the owners, you are the only one who can't be ignored, so I didn't take it lightly.
"They are my friends, human."

Thunk.

After delivering a sharp blow to the back of its head, I grabbed the Warlord's skull and headed towards the gate.
