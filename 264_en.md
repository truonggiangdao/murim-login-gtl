"I never expected to be so glad to see you, Cheongpung. Your arrival could be a tremendous help, especially at a time when the situation is dire."

Unconsciously, a cry of joy escaped from me.

"Cheongpung!"

"Yes, it's me, Eunin."

Seeing Cheongpung respond hesitantly, Hyeolju pretended not to know.

"Oh, I see. So, you're that little rat, the invincible divine sword of Hwasan School."

Just as I suspected. That was the extent of Hyeolju's knowledge about Cheongpung. It had been revealed that Cheongpung was a disciple of Hwasan School, but the fact that he was the youngest disciple who had been raised with great care in swordsmanship, like a beloved child, was still unknown.

At a time like this, to induce carelessness... "No, should I call you the disciple of Gyeomsung? Or maybe grandson?"

What a bastard. He knows everything.

Well, after all, it was an artificial stream that I had been infiltrating and sowing seeds in for decades. Hyeolju must hold a significant position within that stream.

"It's not strange to not know everything."

Seeing my disappointment, Hyeolju smirked.

"Don't make that expression. Adding one more friend won't change anything anyway."

Look at this guy...

Although he was still at the end of his peak, there was no doubt that Cheongpung was an extraordinary existence compared to a typical master at his peak.

I possessed overwhelming abilities and extensive combat experience, while Cheongpung had innate martial prowess and a genius-level sense of battle that allowed him to combine dozens of martial arts in the most opportune moments. And there was Cheongpung's master, Jeokcheon River, known as the strongest among the Four Emperors.

I thought it would be a fight worth trying.

"You underestimate us too much."

"Because it's the truth."

Fly...

"If you wanted to kill me, you should have brought Gyeomsung, not his disciple."

Ugh... This punk.

"There's only one thing left."

Hyeolju responded with a relaxed voice as he flicked his finger towards us.

"Prove yourself with martial arts."

That was the only sentence I had faithfully translated among all the gibberish spoken so far.

That's right. I have to prove myself with martial arts.

If I win the fight, it will prove my strength. If I lose, it will be evidence of my weakness.

"When you meet Yeomra (minus 8), tell him that I was sent by the Hwawang."

Ssaaeeek!

With a voice as sharp as a jet of water, Jeokcheon River's divine blade was unsheathed. At the same time, a familiar notification pierced through.

Ting!

- A sudden quest, [Desperate Situation], has been activated!
- You cannot refuse the quest. The quest is forcefully accepted!

Damn it. The quest title is quite impressive.

I charged forward, venting my frustration on the ground. Amidst the curses, I didn't forget to call out a person's name.

"Cheongpung! Now!"

Reluctantly, Cheongpung rushed forward, wielding his Cheonggang Sword gracefully, drawing plum blossoms in the air.

Whaaah! Shh, shh, shh!

On a secluded path, the Yangyang Guardsman enjoyed the refreshing mountain breeze, deflecting the wind from his spear and sword.

The corners of the mouth of the onlooking Hyeolju twisted.

"Well then... where should we test your skills?"

*Sound of a palm strike*

Jeokcheon Gang shook his hand, and the tension that enveloped the Yangyang Guardsman burst out through his wrinkled palm. It was a fearsome technique, capable of burning even one's soul, aiming to engulf Hyeolju's entire body.

Huff!

A gust of wind blew.

Suddenly, Hyeolju held a short sword in his hand. The flame of the blade burned intensely, cutting the strength of the Flame Divine Palm in half.

Whoosh, hwaaah!

The beautiful cedar trees on both sides of the path exploded.

Amidst the roaring sound, flames erupted, showering down like rain upon the earth, with soil, grass roots, and fragments flying everywhere.

And between them, two flashes streaked through.

Ssweeek! Shh, shh!

Spears and swords shot forward from the front and back.

Hyeolju twisted the corners of his mouth and released the sword from his hand. Simultaneously, his fists, freed from their constraints, struck the air.

Boom!

As compressed air burst out, a violent gust swept through. The blades of the charging spears and the blooming plum blossoms on the sword were swept away by the pressure.

The eyes of Jin Tae-gyeong and Cheongpung widened at their bodies being involuntarily pushed back.

"...Damn it. You're quite something."

"If... things had gone a little differently."

Thud.

Hyeolju retrieved his sword from the air, which had been motionless. He had faced both of them while using the Heavenly Water Palm Technique.

"Is that all you've got?"

Jin Tae-gyeong's eyelids trembled.

He had expected the Flame Divine Palm, which had already achieved greatness, to be effortlessly brushed aside. But it wasn't just blocked; it was completely dismantled.

Hyeolju, with a twisted smile on his lips, realized that this opponent was more than just a master.

"He said to bring the Swordsman if you want to kill him... It seems he wasn't lying."

The opponent was a master who could rival the Three Stars, or perhaps even surpass them.

Strength, understanding of martial arts, nothing was inferior to his own.

In addition, he possessed fresh vitality and a young body capable of fully unleashing those abilities.

On this day, Jin Tae-gyeong felt that his own wrinkled hand was even smaller and more pathetic.

"If only I were twenty or thirty years younger..."

The body was in its prime, lacking in internal energy. When he filled it with understanding, his body had become too feeble.

A leaking vessel cannot hold water. That's how Jin Tae-gyeong felt now.

"Perhaps this place could become my grave."

Hyeolju didn't miss the glare in Jin Tae

-gyeong's eyes.

He raised the corners of his mouth and chuckled.

"Alright then. Are you getting the hang of it now? Do you understand the situation?"

Jin Tae-gyeong casually nodded his head.

He realized that Jin Tae-gyeong and Cheongpung were looking at him with their mouths open.

"Impressive. We've only just begun."

"You guys might think so, but I haven't even started yet."

"What?"

"I heard that masters like you would graciously give three seconds to an inferior opponent. Let me imitate that a bit."

Enyaai,

Hyeolju's long fingers pointed one by one at each person.

Each of the three extended one second, and the sum was three. It meant that he had graciously given them three seconds before taking his position.

"Now it's my turn. Come on, show me what you've got."

A crimson aura flickered in Hyeolju's pupils. At the same time, a white aura tainted with blood and an unmatched tremendous energy emanated from him.

Gugugugung!

Sungsan (44) trembled.

Shh, shh, shh, shh!

Flashes of light filled the surroundings. If you were watching, it felt like your eyes would go blind, and the thunderous noise continued to reverberate without end.

Among them, the most overwhelming was the blade of a single sword emitting a crimson aura.

Gwah-ah!

The powerful blade swung, leaving behind a hazy light.

All the attacks aimed at Hyeolju, trying to block them and erase everything in their destructive path, were weakly repelled.

Of course, my attacks were included among them.

Kwang!

The blade of the White Flame Spear resounded piercingly. The handle, firmly gripped in my palm, vibrated vigorously.

It released an immense power, but it was truly an unbelievable strength. It was beyond what one could believe a human possessed.

"A monster-like guy."

I bit my lip and flipped my body. Shh!

The crimson blade grazed my hair, slicing it off.

However, despite pouring all the points I received as a reward for winning the Seongra Dae-yeon, his movements and power were at a higher level.

But...

Gwadeuk!

The empty hand of the guy grabbed the blade.

It was a bare hand, but it wasn't just a bare hand. A tremendous power, burning with a crimson color, enveloped his hand.

"This won't be enough."

With a calm voice, an incredible force pulled the blade towards him.

And in the next moment, Hyeolju's eyebrows shot up.

The blade that was just in his grasp disappeared.

As if it had never existed from the beginning.

"You...!"

Before the astonished voice could even come out, I had already plunged deep into his embrace.

"Inventory open. Summon: Yeolyangjigi."

In an instant, Yeolyangjigi blazed hotly as it was summoned back into my hand.

The moment when the strongest and sharpest metal, Everlasting Iron, cut through the air, revealing the hidden enemy inside, arrived.

Boom! The sound of an explosion!

As the enemy swung his arm, his powerful strength struck the ship.

I was pushed back several steps, and what came into my view was the face of a bloodthirsty man and the fountain of blood gushing from his chest.

It was a surprise attack using a system that no one could have expected, and it overwhelmed the enemy because it was an attack that even the vigilant would not anticipate.

"Now is the chance, a golden opportunity that may never come again. It is the last lifeline that must not be missed.

I shouted, swallowing the blood rising in my throat.

My shout echoed through the desolate path, piercing the air, carried by the wind. It reached the ears of a powerful figure.

A hot voice flowed from his lips. "Well done."

In an instant, the old man transformed into the Fire King. A tremendous aura emanated from his small figure, igniting the air and suppressing the wind.

If the aura of the enemy was something that could make anyone wary, then the power of the Fire King was the very essence of heat that could engulf the world.

"This dog-like...!"

The enemy, known as the Blood Lord, groaned like a whimper.

But it was already too late. Although it was difficult to discern with the naked eye, I knew. I knew what the Blood Lord was doing, the power it possessed.

He had used that martial art only once before, becoming a legend by killing a thousand followers of the Demon Sect.

'Flame Divine Art.'

In that moment, the Blood Lord's figure disappeared.

Like a dance, his hands and feet approached the Blood King with light steps, blurry like mist.

A crimson and blue blaze filled the sky and earth. It was a beautiful yet terrifyingly destructive flash.

"Fire King!"

With a fierce roar from the Blood King and the collision of the crimson blade, the cliff collapsed, and a thunderous sound echoed as if the sky was tearing apart.

"This is...!"

It was an unimaginable exchange of attacks that even the trained eye couldn't follow. It hadn't been long since it started, but I could understand.

In that brief moment, hundreds of powerful attacks were exchanged. And I could tell who emerged as the victor.

Crack!

The wave of heat engulfed the crimson blade. The enemy's body was thrown into the pile of upturned earth, lifeless.

A single sword. Its owner, who should have wielded it, awaited the final blow.

"Lord Nobu said it himself. Even if it's not a human but a deity, I will kill them."

With a resolute voice, the enemy's chest was struck.

Snap! His flesh burned, and his chest bone crumbled. The Blood King coughed up blood and knelt with a blurred gaze.

And... that was all.

The figure of the Fire King, who had been watching the Blood King's motionless face, staggered.

"Shifu!"

In a hurry, I and Qingfeng rushed forward, supporting the injured Blood King and moving him to a nearby forest.

Flame Divine Art.

There is no eternal fire. When the dance ends, the fire extinguishes, and the heat subsides.

It was also because the Blood King, who had lived for countless years, could only use that powerful technique once.

"How is it? Isn't it exactly as Lord Nobu said?"

"What are you talking about?"

"Flame Divine Art. It was incredible, wasn't it?"

Smiling faintly, I sighed with relief, and soon followed suit.

"I did it."

That was sincere. Everything was over.

But in the next moment, if it weren't for the voice coming from behind me, it would have been enough.

"Flame Divine Art... What a cool name."

Slowly turning my head, the sight of the Blood King rising with a gentle smile filled my eyes.
