First class!

The iron golem's body, known for its extreme hardness, is being sliced like soft tofu.
Even steel infused with magical power fails to withstand the cooling effect.

With each swing and thrust of the blade, a trail of fire is left behind, and water drips.
Clang! Clang!

- You have defeated [4/0.95 Iron Golem]!

- I gained a substantial amount of experience points!

- You have defeated [495 Iron Golem]!

- A significant boost in experience points...
"What? Why are you so weak?"

It has reached a point where I am bewildered.

The Iron Golem is a rather, no, an incredibly formidable monster. Unless you destroy its core, it won't die, and its offensive power and durability are incredibly high.

"It possesses regenerative abilities surpassing those of a troll and the destructive force of an ogre serpent."

Moreover, it possesses tireless stamina and magic resistance.

Its only flaw is that it is a bit slow, but considering the numerous advantages it possesses, I wonder if this can even be called a flaw.
No wonder it is regarded as a higher-ranked creature among golems, even among S-class monsters.
However... ... ...

"Why is this so easy?"

Whoa!

The wind tousles her hair as an iron golem's fist descends towards the top of her head.

Screams erupt among the new guild members.

"Dangerous!"

I need to educate them. When you perceive your teammates are in danger, you should grab even the tiniest stones rolling nearby to divert the enemy's attention. What are you doing?

"Well, it's because I'm new."
I click my tongue and clench my fists.
In a split second, years of energy surge through my arm.

Yeolyangkeeper stands on the fist of reconciliation, surrounded by blue flames.

And... ...

Jjoong!

It was a clash of fists, a collision between Tekken (Iron Fist) and Muryeom Shin-Kwon 08*Ke (Infinite Divine Fist 08*Ke).

The ground crumbles with a metallic sound, and compressed air bursts forth. I witness the iron golem staggering backward in the midst of the raging wind.

An arm that was solid mere moments ago turns into water and falls, as if devoured by a fire dragon.
- What?

The Iron Golem is a soulless magical puppet.

But now, I feel like I've sensed a hint of embarrassment from it.

"Uh, naturally, it needs to be baked."

He kicked the ground and charged forward.
The iron golem's front chest, shimmering with purple, caught my attention. I could sense it.

The core of the golem pulsates from the depths of its chest, releasing mana into the enormous body of a creature devoid of qi.

"This Hunter bakes for free."

With an open palm, he struck the golem's chest. The cool metal was engulfed by the flames' scorching heat (&\8 breaking).

Chii-iik, water splashed out, leaving a gaping hole in the golem's chest. The mana-supplying core was shattered without resistance.
= Gwuuu.

Koo Goo Goo!

The massive body, now devoid of its core, loses power and crumbles into pieces. Just like a man with a ruptured heart can't breathe, neither can the Iron Golem.

I landed lightly on top of the debris, piled up like a small garden.

"Okay, next."

- Bake it!

With a roar resembling mechanical sounds, a barrage of flashing steel comes from all sides.
"If I manage to withstand all of this, I'll level up once."

I swung the spear with anticipation. The Fire Dragon Goddess (%800), now at 7-star level, carved a path of fire, burning the air and resonating with sound.

Wow!

Kugu Palace!

With a mighty roar, the final iron golem collapsed.
It took only a few minutes to deal with dozens of S-class monsters.

As I looked around, everyone stared at me with astonishment on their faces.

"This is insane."

"Did you see that? Did you really see it?"

"Yes, I saw it."

"Wow, I played with an S-class monster.
It's something you don't get to see often."

"Because I saw it."

Voices murmured among the new guild members, who were still in awe.
"Is the raid already finished? After the battle, gather the remains and stay alert. I hope the guild leader and Mr. Songi will take charge."

The words were respectful, but the tone was sharp, like a whip.

The new recruits, taken aback by Team Leader Choi's arrival and his calm demeanor, hurried to find something to do.

"Sometimes, you encounter someone with charisma.

Should I call it a unique aura? It's something innate."

While pondering over that thought, Team Leader Choi approached me directly, wearing a serious expression.

"Jin Tae-kyung. I've been contemplating it for a while, but now I can't hold it in any longer."

"Yes?"

"Where did you buy that spear?"

Yes, I've always been like this. She seemed momentarily lost in thought.

Whether he understood my thoughts or not, Team Leader Choi's gaze remained fixed on the spear in my hand, the White Flame (site*).

"It's like looking at a work of art. A classic yet beautiful design with Chinese influences. Could it be made with magic stones?"

Well, it was crafted over a thousand years.

Of course, telling the truth would be troublesome, so I simply glanced around.

"Don't worry. I don't know either."

Team Leader Choi raised his eyebrows with a covetous gaze.

"Sorry, but if you ever consider selling it...?"

"It's not possible. I don't sell them."

Even if I wanted to sell it, I couldn't. It's a bound item that only I can use. It's also clearly stated in the item information.

Perhaps due to this, it's the only item in my inventory that can freely travel between the two worlds of Moorim and Hyundai.

"Iced coffee... 2"
Team Leader Choi licked his lips in disappointment and changed the subject.

"Anyway, I was genuinely surprised. You're getting stronger."

I replied, half-jokingly and half-seriously.

"It's enough to learn how to die for a year from a master with dementia."
"Dementia? What?"

"A profoundly heightened demand."

"Isn't that a term from martial arts novels? Supreme master, transcendent master."

"That's right. When I retire in the future, I want to write something as a hobby. No login. Maybe with a title like that."

"The title sounds cheesy. It wouldn't become a hit."

"To be honest, I have no intention of actually writing it."

Team Leader Choi smiled and opened up.

"I know I say this every time, but sometimes when I see Jin Tae-kyung, I can't help but think about it."

"Think about what?"

"I wonder if this person is the same as me."

From the corner of his eyes, his brown eyes seemed to emit a reddish glow.

"A latecomer ã€Žlevel hunter becoming this strong in just a few months? If I hadn't witnessed it with my own eyes, I wouldn't believe it."

It's a reasonable doubt.

The Second Awakened is not common, but it's not so rare that it's extremely rare either.
However, in my case, I have achieved a level that far exceeds the average Second Awakened individual.
Moreover, Team Leader Choi is the person who has observed me the closest.
"I don't know about others, but Team Leader Choi is not easily fooled."

In his eyes, I am no different from a 2nd, 3rd, or 4th Awakened individual.

My lips feel dry.

This is a secret that I must keep until the day I die.
If it ever gets revealed, I might be taken by the NIS, no, 4454, and spend the rest of my life as a test subject.

"Manager, I'm sorry but...?"

Chief Choi shook his head slightly and interrupted me.

"I understand. Even Jin Tae-gyeong has a secret. In a way, I'm in a similar position, so I have no intention of prying."

A similar position?

His words continued before the question fully formed in my mind.
"An unprecedented Second Awakened hunter. That should be enough.
Deacon Kim shares the same opinion."

Song Song and Lim Jik-jeong joined the team later, but it was Deacon Kim who witnessed my growth under Team Leader Choi's guidance.

It's already a "Class Hunter's Rebellion, Miracle." Well, if the two of them keep quiet in the midst of the internet news articles pouring in with such titles, it can end at this point.

I bowed my head.

"Thank you. I am grateful."
"By the way, can I ask you one question?"

"Anything."

"Why are you doing this?"

"Ha. That's the question."

Team Leader Choi laughed, the sound resembling the blowing wind.

"Weren't we just talking about owing each other? I'm thinking of taking advantage of that and repaying the debt with interest."

"Just keep that in mind, then."

After speaking, Team Leader Choi attempted to turn around but paused.

"If you ever write the novel you mentioned earlier, please show it to me. I prefer reading novels over watching."

"Then you won't be able to read mine."

"Why is that?"

If I were to write, it wouldn't be a novel that you would enjoy, but rather an essay based on my experiences.

Team Leader Choi smiled in response to my silent smile.

The workshop, or raid, which was initially planned for six nights and seven days, concluded in just three days.

That was because there were no more monsters to defeat after I went around alone, taking care of the prominent ones.

"Originally, the purpose was to foster unity through raids, but it turned out like this."

I slipped away from Songsongi's gaze, which looked at me as if it were absurd.

That was because I single-handedly defeated the boss monster and wiped out the golems inside the gate.

The feeling of accomplishment was truly satisfying.

"Even newcomers need to gain raid experience. Why are you so impatient when you see monsters?"

"Good is good. Let's move on."

"Hey, Jin Tae-kyung."
"Oh, hey. Let's keep going, Songsongi."

"What if I just can't move on?"

"I'll confess and punish you."

Song Song-yi, who remained silent, slowly retreated with a frightened expression on her face.

She had achieved her goal, but why did I feel like crying?

'Ah, I loved...'

She walked with heavy steps, just like the male protagonist.

As they exited the dungeon, the reporters stationed outside the gate immediately began firing their camera flashes.

I had spent a year in Moorim, but only a few days in Heondae.

It would take some time for the interest and excitement surrounding me to die down.

"Wait a minute! Keep your distance, journalists!"

"Only officials are allowed to enter from this point!"

It was only after the guards intervened and blocked the reporters that we were able to escape from the onslaught of flashing cameras.

Once the sound of shutters ceased, the new guild members, their faces flushed with excitement, cheered loudly.

"You did great!"

Everyone's eyes were shining brightly. The looks they gave us were filled with envy and respect.

And of course, I was the center of attention.

Feeling a bit embarrassed for no reason, I turned my gaze to the original members, only to realize that one person was missing.

"What about Uncle Kim Chung?"

"Huh? I haven't seen him since then."

Team Leader Choi replied, "On the way back, he only talked to me briefly and disappeared. I heard something happened."

"What could it be? Did he leave immediately without changing his equipment?"

"Is it something urgent?"

What could it be? Are there any issues at home?

A strange uneasiness crept into a corner of my heart.

"Come to think of it, I haven't had a conversation with him since we returned."

He had been mostly alone during the raid, so he didn't have many conversations with others. Looking back now, he noticed that Lim's expression seemed a bit dark. At the time, he thought it was just due to nervousness.

"Is there really a major issue?" The thought lingered in his mind even after changing his equipment and parting ways with the team.

He contemplated whether to make a phone call, but ultimately decided to send a message to the saved contact instead, inviting them for a drink soon. He figured there might be some personal concerns, and it could be a pointless mistake to interfere.

"That should be enough." He stared at the number 1 on the screen that hadn't disappeared.

Then, his smartphone trembled, indicating an incoming call. The screen displayed the name of someone he had saved a few months ago but hadn't contacted since.

[Garam Middle School alumni Park Ji-hoon]

This person was someone he had coincidentally encountered while buying a house. He had forgotten about him until now.

"What's up with this guy?" He answered the call with a hint of curiosity.
