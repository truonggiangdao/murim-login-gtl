"The Law King, the one they call the Taesanbukdu of the Wulin, the head of the Soryimsa and one of the disciples of Simwang (+Po), has passed away. And it happened here in Hanam, the very place where the Seongra Daeyeon is taking place.

"This... This can't be."

"Great Master Guksa!"

Sadness and shock weighed heavily in the air, but my gaze was fixed solely on one person.

"No, not just a senior monk, but my master."

I turned my head towards the rigid figure of Guksa, like a statue made of plaster.

"Noya, no, Master."

As I looked down at Guksa's lifeless body, my mind was consumed by a surge of emotions. But amidst the overwhelming desire for revenge against Janglichu, one thing stood above all.

"What could be more important than seeking vengeance for my dearest friend?"

"Is that the late Master Guksa's final wish?"

"Not now. We must hurry."

In a voice that flowed like flowing lava, I suppressed the urge to immediately go after Janglichu and end his life.

What could be so important that it takes precedence over avenging my closest friend?

"Is that Master Guksa's dying wish?"

"I will tell you later. Right now, we need to take swift action."

As I finished speaking, the sound of dozens of footsteps rapidly approaching grew closer. Among them, the leading figure, Byeokryeokdowang, widened his eyes at the sight that unfolded before him.

"G-Guksa!"

"There's no time for astonishment. Listen to me carefully."

"I'm going to the Soryimsa."

With an intensity that felt like a razor-sharp blade emanating from the entirety of the body of Hwawang Jukcheon, my breath became shallow, and a tingling sensation ran through my entire being.

However, there was one thing, and one thing only, that remained cold in my gaze.

"Did you say the Soryimsa?"

"Yes."

With a grave expression, Jukcheon lowered his head.

"If Master Guksa's dying wish is true... It won't be long before a bloody storm engulfs the Soryimsa. It may have already begun."

Hushed silence filled the room at his shocking words. Even Byeorokdowang stood there with his mouth agape, unable to utter a word. I was no different.

"The Soryimsa?"

The Soryimsa, what kind of place was it? It was referred to as the Taesanbukdu of the Wulin, an illustrious temple and martial arts sect deserving of such a title.

Some even believed that the Wulin began with the appearance of the great monk, Dalmadaesa.

It was the holy land of Wubei (0092) and the headquarters of martial arts. Even if the power of the Soryimsa waned, its deep-rooted history and the reverence of its disciples remained unshakable.

And now, a bloody storm was about to descend upon the very Soryimsa.

"What... What does that mean? The dying wish of Master Guksa, and who dares to touch the Soryimsa?"

"Gal (tremble)!"

Gwaahh!

Jukcheon's powerful strike jolted everyone's senses awake. Even Byeorokdowang, who was babbling just moments ago, fell silent.

"Amcheon (prime*). They have started moving. If Nobleman Noh's prediction is correct, then Janglichu, that damned bastard, will

 eventually show up at the Soryimsa."

"Amcheon...!"

The leader of the Sangha Temple, known as the "Tai Mountain of the Martial World," and a close companion of Simwang, named Gwangdo, passed away. It happened in Hanam, the forefront of the Sangha and the site of the Sunglae Festival.

"I can't believe this."

"Gwangdo Master!"

Sadness and shock overwhelmed the room, but my gaze was fixed on one person.

"No, not just a master, a teacher."

I approached Gwangdo's lifeless body, staring at his rigid back like a statue made of plaster.

"Master, or rather, teacher."

Jungcheon-gang, who had been looking at Gwangdo's body, turned his head.

"We must go to Sulin."

His voice sounded like flowing lava, with a sharpness that made it difficult to breathe.

But there was only one thing, his gaze remained cold.

What could be more important than seeking revenge for his dearest friend?

"Is it Gwangdo's final wish?"

"Later. We need to act urgently now."

As Jungcheon-gang finished speaking, dozens of figures rapidly approached from afar. Among them, the leader of the Byukryeokdo clan, Byukryeokdowang, looked stunned at the scene unfolding before him.

"G-Gwangdo!"

"We don't have time to be surprised, listen to me carefully."

"I will go to Sulin. I will inform everyone and gather them. We can't delay this."

"Jungli-chu, are you planning to deploy the Jeonraji net (※088) to capture him?"

"It's the opposite."

"What do you mean?"

"The opposite is true. Manli-chu is tracking him, but he will fail. Once people gather, they will come to Sulin immediately."

"Did you say Sulin just now?"

"Yes."

Jungcheon-gang lowered his head with a heavy expression.

"If Gwangdo's testament is true... perhaps a bloody storm (0ㅁ/00) will soon engulf Sulin. Maybe it has already begun."

These shocking words silenced the room. Even Byukryeokdowang, who usually spoke freely, was left speechless.

"Sulin?"

What is Sulin? It is a renowned temple in the martial world, referred to as the "Tai Mountain of the Martial World," and a prominent sect.

Some even claim that the martial world began with the appearance of Dalma Daesa in Sulin.

As the holy site of Bulbok (0092) and the headquarters of martial arts, Sulin's power may fluctuate, but its deep-rooted history and the respect of its disciples remained strong.

And now, a bloody storm is approaching Sulin.

"What... What does this mean? Gwangdo's testament? Who dares to touch Sulin?"

"Quiet!"

Jungcheon-gang's firm voice silenced the crowd. Byukryeokdowang also closed his mouth, shocked by the intensity.

"Let's go, find Sulin!"

"They might be hiding nearby!"

"Everyone, stay calm. Nothing will happen!"

The Martial Arts Alliance was as chaotic as a disturbed beehive.

Numerous martial artists attending the Sunglae Festival scoured the vicinity in search of Jongli-chu, and the common people moved anxiously under control.

"It's all in vain."

They are still unaware that Jongli-chu has already fled far away and that Gwangdo, the Law King, has passed away.

On the one hand, I considered informing them, but I quickly erased the thought from my mind.

"It will only worsen the chaos."

Moreover, I don't have the luxury to personally inform every leader of the situation.

With just a slight time difference, they will soon learn the truth themselves.

"Now, we must follow Jongli-chu."

"We are running out of time."

Fortunately, the distance to Sulin Temple is not too far.

That's the only fortunate fact. After passing the preliminary qualifications, it took about three hours by carriage from Sungsan to the Martial Arts Alliance. If we continue to use our martial skills as we do now, time will be drastically shortened.

Shuwaak!

Running like a hurricane, the bustling crowd and the countless buildings in the distant city disappeared, revealing a vast plain.

When we crossed the wide open field, Jongli-chu, who had been silently leading the way, suddenly opened his mouth.

"Jongli-chu, Amcheon (0198), Muyong (0028), Buljang (0000)."

He spoke with a muted voice, uttering four words.

If someone who didn't know heard them, they would appear to be meaningless words. But I understood immediately.

It was the bold plan I had been waiting for.

"Is that the testament of the Law King?"

"Yes. It required all my strength to extract it."

"Even though he had already passed away, he was still in a state where it wouldn't be strange. That's why he sent me to deliver the message to No-bu (※283)."

The momentary trembling voice of Jeok Cheon-gang subsided.

"What do you think?"

"It's just a guess, not a certainty. Tell me without holding back."

"The first two words, U-won, seem to indicate that Jeong Ri-chu is referring to Amcheon without needing further explanation."

"And?"

"Moo-myeong, Buljang... I'm not sure, to be honest."

"Do you remember the disciples of Gwangdo?"

"Yes, I do."

Vivid memories from a year ago resurfaced. The young martial artist he met in a tavern in Hanam was none other than Gwangdo's disciple. He introduced himself as Moo-myeong. So the Moo-myeong mentioned by Gwangdo was indeed him. Could it be that Gwangdo entrusted him with a disciple's duty on his final journey?

"But what about Buljang? Are you referring to the staff-like object that the monks carry?"

Jeok Cheon-gang nodded.

"That's right. However, the Buljang mentioned by Gwangdo refers to the Nok-ok Buljang (& Jo 8), the sacred object of Sorim."

"Nok-ok Buljang?"

Suddenly, a scene from that day, when Jeok Cheon-gang and Gwangdo laughed and exchanged stories, flashed through his mind.

"What were those guys thinking? They entrusted the position of the abbess to someone who claims to do nothing. Entrusting the thousand-year-old sacred object of Sori"

"I am certain of everything now.

Jongrichu, or rather Amcheon, clearly desires the sacred water of Sollim. Gwangdo must have left a testament about it to convey that fact.

It was evident to even a three-year-old child where Amcheon's footsteps were heading.

"The blood wind will blow in Sollim."

Recalling the words of Jeokcheon Gang to the Wallbreaker King, a chilling sensation ran through my mind.

※ ※ *

Tap, tap!

Breathless, hurried footsteps.

The voice that hindered the footsteps of the middle-aged man was a hoarse voice.

"It seems the young friend is occupied with important matters."

The owner of the voice was an elderly man with a beard that extended to his chest. He seemed like a retired scholar at first glance.

"The weather is nice, wouldn't it be better to walk while enjoying the surrounding scenery?"

The middle-aged man's eyebrows furrowed noticeably.

The tense voice leaked through his lips.

"Who is it?"

"Just an old wanderer passing by. I came here because I heard that the scenery of Mount Sungsan (비) is lovely and thought it would be a good place for a stroll."

"A stroll, you say?"

The middle-aged man exclaimed with disbelief.

"Keep your voice down! You also must have been an evil madu (08)!"

The old man smiled, his eyes widening.

"The young friend has a fiery temperament. Still, you're much better than the people I met earlier. They were just spewing lies all the time."

"Earlier?... Could it be?"

"Lumberjack, herbalist. So many 'workers' around. Oh, those couple pretending to be husband and wife were somewhat decent. They almost fooled even a fool like Nopudo."

The old man gently stroked his beard.

"I ended up killing all those pretenders, regardless of whether they were Wulin or Yangmin... It was much easier that way."

The middle-aged man's body trembled as if struck by lightning.

Undoubtedly, his scattered colleagues had already met their deaths while trying to deliver the urgent message.

Soon, he himself would meet the same fate.

"At least I should be grateful that it wasn't a more miserable death. The people on the ground were trapped in a net, but not the sky."

In the distance, he found solace in watching Junsueng soar vigorously above the plains.

Swish!

With a sharp sound, something distant and unknown attacked Junsueng.

At first glance, it was several times larger than him. The battle between the two beasts that collided in the air ended quickly, leaving a sense of despair.

Crash. With a thud, Junsueng's burned body collapsed, and someone's foot stepped on the middle-aged man's head that had turned into a forest.

"Hansu (90), what kind of foolishness is this? Fooling around with these worthless scoundrels."

The owner of the rough voice was a sturdy old man with peculiar crimson hair that had grown freely.

The old man, who had been together with Hansu for many years, smiled wryly.

"I was planning to finish it off nicely. How about you?"

"You dare to do this and...!"

Before the middle-aged man could shout with bloodshot eyes, the old man interrupted him.

"No, not you."

Then, he pointed with his withered finger beyond the middle-aged man's shoulder.

"I asked that friend over there."

Smirking, Hansu laughed.

"Well, I've been busy enjoying the show. Ah, I heard that the disciple of Nokok Bul

jang has it."

"Is that so? Then let's go together. Yeomho (&) 8"

The two men, with a sly smile, leisurely changed their pace.

With each step, the screams coming from Sollim Temple grew closer.
