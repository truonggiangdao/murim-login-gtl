- Sigh. Phew.

Choi Min-woo took a deep breath.

As he absorbed the air permeating the atmosphere, he awakened the dormant energy in his lower abdomen.

"Mana (1908)."

The source of power given to Awakened Ones. The greatest weapon to fight against monsters.
However, the one who taught him the true essence of mana, Jin Tae-kyung, called it by a different name.

Gongryeok (582).

Jin Tae-kyung was a person who grew more mysterious the more you got to know him. He executed and succeeded in things that others could never have imagined.

The things he taught were never ordinary.

Danjeon, gongryeok, ungi-josaek, jinga sim.
Every time he faced a new aspect of him, Min-woo felt not only amazed but also confused this time.

"To casually teach the secrets of mana cultivation like this."

Choi Min-woo knew how remarkable the technique of jinga sim was.

No, not just hunters, even ordinary people with a little knowledge would quickly recognize its value.

If a hunter is a sword, jinga sim is the whetstone.

No matter how dull a sword may be, it becomes sharp when sharpened on a whetstone.

Considering the effectiveness and rarity of jinga sim... its value would be astronomical.

"To distribute such an incredible vision without hesitation, the ability to single-handedly defeat named monsters, and the audacity to not back down even in the face of Jeong Jeong-ryung and Ares Guild... Is there anyone else like this?"

Choi Min-woo's days were becoming more exciting. He realized how extraordinary Jin Tae-kyung was and how lucky he himself was.

"I can't let his expectations go to waste."

That was why Choi Min-woo saved every bit of his sleeping time and devoted himself to the training of jinga sim.

And the results were already appearing at this very moment.

Suaaaa.

Unaware of the passage of time, Choi Min-woo focused on ungi-josaek. After a while, the immense energy swelled up, moving through hundreds of blood vessels, subtly expanding its size.

Until just a week ago, he didn't even know of the existence of this energy.

In an instant, the conversation he had with Jin Tae-kyung that day flashed through Min-woo's mind.

"Hey, Team Leader."

"Yes?"

"Have you ever had something good when you were young? Like mountain ginseng or a round pill."

"Not at all. My meals were always organic, but I never ate anything special."

"From a young age until now, you've never even caught a common cold, right? That's right, isn't it?"

"That's correct. How did you know?"

"It's because... well, your bones... No, your body is exceptionally healthy."

"Is that so? But every hunter would have a healthy body, right?"

"It's not because you're a hunter. Your body is naturally exceptional. In my opinion, maybe your grandfather did something for his grandson."

"My grandfather...?"

"Yes. Is there no wet part anywhere?"

"I'm not sure, to be honest. I was very young, so I don't remember much. According to what I heard from Kim, my grandfather used to visit occasionally... That's all I know."

"Well, personally, I think that seems to be the only solution."

Choi Min-woo suddenly remembered his grandfather. The last time he saw him was probably before starting elementary school.
The face that remained in his memory was blurry, but the pictures he saw online were clear. The two of them, his grandfather and him, were clearly distant from each other in many ways.

"But if there was such a powerful energy hidden within him... Could it be that my grandfather was involved?"

Unexpectedly, the discovery of his grandfather's trace struck Choi Min-woo's heart like a double-edged sword.

In response to that, the energy flowing through his body trembled.

Jin Tae-gyeong's immense energy, which Min-woo referred to as "Il Gapja," circled around once before settling smoothly below his navel, at the danjeon point.

At that moment, along with a tingling sensation, Min-woo opened his eyes.

"Phew."

The aftermath of the powerful breath he took filled the long exhale.

Unbeknownst to Choi Min-woo, he had just reached the 4th stage of Jin-ga Simbeop, a remarkable achievement within a week, which was hard to believe.

"But others are still unaware."

As Choi Min-woo looked around, his gaze fell on three people who were engrossed in energy cultivation.

They were Kim Jipsa, Song Song-i, and Im Jjik-jeong, sitting at regular intervals.

The fact that these four individuals were mastering Jin-ga Simbeop was a top-secret among top-secrets.

Currently, they were in Choi Min-woo's private training room, which had strict security measures in place.

"We shouldn't disturb them."

Choi Min-woo had already heard about the dangerous phenomenon called Ju-hwa Ipmah (※$(ㅅ0) from Jin Tae-gyeong.

Carefully leaving the training room, Choi Min-woo took out his phone that had been turned off for a while. Within a minute, his mouth gaped open.

The breaking news on his phone's screen was being updated at a blinding speed.
- Reappearance of Named Monster! Crisis in South Korea!
- An anomaly in the 2nd-class gate, "The Black Forest of the Black Mage."
- Jin Tae-gyeong, who voluntarily became a decoy. Witnesses testify, "He is the possessor of noble sacrifice"; an unforgettable benefactor.
- Hunter Association formulates countermeasures and prepares for the rescue team's departure.
- Peace Guild representative, "No contact with the current leadership...?"
- Netizens criticize the weak response from the association. Jin Tae-gyeong isolated for 20 minutes.
- Will a miracle happen?

"What is this?"

What does this sacrifice and isolation they're talking about mean?

Choi Min-woo, bewildered, hurriedly regained his composure.

"I shouldn't be distracted now. I already know Jin Tae-gyeong's abilities."

However, if Jin Tae-gyeong chose to become a decoy and let the guild members escape first, it meant they were facing a tremendous threat.

"This is... really dangerous."

Squeezing his phone tightly in his hand, Choi Min-woo felt a sense of urgency. Just then, the tightly closed door of the training room opened, revealing the three individuals.

"Oh, how refreshing."

"Oh, sir. Do you think my skin looks better?"

"Oh, you're already out, Young Master..."

"Kim Jipsa-nim!"

A single urgent shout was enough. The faces of the three people hardened, sensing that something unusual had happened.

Kim Jipsa calmly asked, "What's happening?"

"I need to go to Jin Taekyung. Right now!"

The entrance of the "Black Mage's Dark Forest" gate was bustling with gathered people. There were hunters dispatched for safety, both from the association and other guilds. Even journalists risking their lives to cover the exclusive news.

Hundreds of people conversed loudly, filling the surroundings with their voices.

"Did Jin Taekyung die?"

"It's difficult to say. It's been an hour without any news."

"Still, he has already defeated a named monster once..."

"Oh, you mean the Wyvern from before? It was impressive. Truly impressive..."

A senior journalist, who was talking with a junior colleague, tapped his cigarette.

"You're a hunter journalist, too. Can't you think for a moment? You didn't hear the interview with the Peace Guild member who was with Jin Taekyung earlier? It wasn't just one named monster; there were hundreds more. It's a different situation."

"Is it that serious?"

"Well, it is. If it were anyone other than Jin Taekyung, they would probably say 'probably' or 'it's difficult.' Do you think any hunter can survive alone for an hour? The rescue preparations are bullshit. He's probably already dead, and they're getting ready to recover his body."

The junior colleague sighed softly. "It's such a difficult situation."

"Yeah, it is. We're crazy for being here, trying to jot down some notes."

"But now that there's some level of safety guaranteed, they allowed coverage, right?"

"Don't you see over there? More than thirty level 2 hunters have come."

In the direction the senior journalist nodded, there were dozens of hunters who stood out, with their chests adorned with a crossed sword and shield emblem.

"Ares Guild has also been dispatched."

"They just arrived. These guys are the ones who won't even give a shit if the estimate doesn't come through... I don't know what wind blew them here."

"Did they come to rescue Jin Taekyung?"

"Maybe. That could be one reason, or maybe they're after the named monster."

Named monsters have tremendous value. Even the recently slain Wyvern and the "One-Eyed Karus" that Jin Taekyung defeated were considered named monsters, with values that surpassed individual fortunes.

"But... with this many people, can't they start the rescue operation now? They have enough power, don't they?"

"They do have enough power. But you think those guys have the same thoughts?"

"What do you mean?"

"Well, never mind."

The senior journalist closed his mouth after those words. He was a veteran among veterans, having spent nearly 20 years in this field. His eyes and ears were everywhere, and he had seen and heard a lot.

"He must have been annoying to Jin Taekyung."

Recently, I heard some strange news from a reliable source.

It was information about an unsettling situation between the Myeongdong and Peace guilds. Although it turned out to be a rumor that quickly faded away, the experienced journalist in me had a hunch that something was going on, especially with the appearance of the Ares Guild.

It felt odd, a feeling that couldn't be explained in words.

A journalist, observing the gathering of the authorities, furrowed his brows.

"He looks familiar. What was his name? Seokgosang? Seokgojun? The security team leader of the Ares Guild, or practically the guild leader himself, Jeongryong. That's what I heard."

Seeing the casual demeanor of the Seoul Branch Association's president, who seemed more like a guild member, I could vaguely understand why the rescue team deployment was delayed.

"These guys, they're having fun."

It was at that moment, while a senior journalist was murmuring and flicking his half-finished cigarette, that the chaotic atmosphere erupted with the shouts of broadcasting crew members.

"It's the Peace Guild!"

"What? Where?"

"Hey, get the cameras ready!"

The bustling crowd's attention focused on a particular spot as four individuals, three men and one woman, moved through the crowd like a crimson wave and stood in front of the gate. That is, until they were stopped by the hunters from the Seoul Branch.

"Please step aside."

The young man at the front, Choi Min-woo, spoke with a calm and firm voice, to which the president of the Seoul Association, who had hurriedly approached, replied.

"Safety hasn't been confirmed yet. We need more time for the rescue operation..."

"Time? Are you talking about more time here?"

"Just a moment, just a short moment is enough."

"It's been almost an hour already."

The voice remained composed, but the eyes flickered with a fiery intensity. The three individuals standing behind him were the same.

"We need to save him immediately."

"Not now. Let's follow the plan."

"Whose plan? The association's? Or... ah, I see."

In a fleeting moment, Choi Min-woo's gaze passed over the president's shoulder and landed on Seokgojun, who was standing behind him. He tightly bit his lips and spoke.

"Please hand over the association's hunters to us. Even if it's just our Peace Guild."

"You must be aware that it goes against the regulations."

The president replied in an authoritative tone, raising his finger. The hunters from the Seoul Association surrounded the Peace Guild members with expressionless faces.

"It won't take long. Have some patience and wait."

With that one remark, Choi Min-woo's patience snapped. He shouted as if erupting like a volcano.

"He's in there! My friend is inside!"

Click, flash!

The cameras captured that moment, and blinding flashes went off. However, Choi Min-woo didn't flinch. His angry outcry continued.

"He could die! We must save him no matter what!"

The named monster leading the hundreds of skeleton troops, a Skeleton Warlord. The anger erupted like a volcano as he thought about Jin Tae-gyeong, who must be on the verge of death.

"Get out of the way, you bastards!"

*** *** ***
The Skeleton Warlord spoke with a dignified voice.

- 8697 ?/ To the Bangno, Eun 99038 2797, a loyal Sura-sum with a diligent and skilled bow.

In that moment, someone swiftly struck the Warlord's skull with lightning-fast movement.

Thud!

"Damn it. Spells are unnecessarily long. I told you to do it quickly."

"No response?"

The Warlord mumbled in an irritated voice.

- 89608, Amon Hapu...:

Swoosh!

The magical sword, released from the Warlord, swept through the dark forest.

A bright smile formed on the young man's lips as he watched the skeletons sprouting up from the ground.

"Well, this harvest is bountiful too."
