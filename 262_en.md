Waiting for us as we arrived, giving it our all, was a horrifying sight that was beyond description. Corpses, bloodstains, severed limbs, and the scene of Songlim Temple I witnessed with my own eyes years ago, if it was a beautiful painting of a tranquil garden, what unfolded before me now was hell.

"These insane bastards..."

They had clearly killed indiscriminately, whether it was commoners or martial artists.

Beyond the masked figures fighting against the monks of Songlim Temple, I saw Eunhee with red whiskers.

"Hwawang...!"

Without taking my gaze off Eunhee, I asked Numeunyi.

"Do you know him?"

"I don't."

"And the monk underneath?"

"Gwangcheon. He's the youngest priest of Gwangdo. It seems he's caused a lot of trouble in the meantime."

"Is that so?"

It seemed like he had caused more trouble than I had heard.

In that moment, when I was at a loss for words, Numeunyi's intense gaze swept over us.

"Are you the only ones?"

Jeokcheon answered indifferently.

"If that's the case?"

"Heh, it seems Numeunyi has finally found a place to die."

"Even if your head is empty, you should speak up. It's not a place to die, but a place to kill. That includes all of you."

Numeunyi's eyebrows twitched.

"Guango... It's no different."

"Has anything changed? Have you met Nobu?"

"I saw him from afar. It was a lingering regret that we didn't have a chance to compete."

"What's his name?"

"Yeomho! I am the one and only tiger of Namman!"

"The Yin and Yang Twin Blades? Good. There's one more person who needs to be taken care of, so it's okay to kill you all without taking you alive."

Jeokcheon held back his anger.

"By the way, you're a ridiculously lucky bastard. Turning your back on Samdochun."

"Is that really the case?"

Eunyi's eyes flickered with fire. At the same time, his fist, which looked rough and solid like a rock, clenched tightly.

I had expected it, but that Numeunyi was undoubtedly an extremely skilled martial artist. He had even trained in the same martial arts style as us.

"You think you're faster than what you heard?"

For a moment, I wondered how Numeunyi had received information so quickly, even if we had used the fastest means possible.

"Even if we used a messenger pigeon, we would have been faster than him."

But I had to put aside those doubts. It was because Numeunyi had grabbed Gwangcheon's head as if he was going to crush it.

Blood dripped from the mouth of the old monk, his entire body covered in bloodstained armor.

"Do you want to save this guy?"

Jeokcheon could feel the tension in Numeunyi's body.

Eunyi and Yeomho gathered their strength to evade the attack together. In that moment, Numeunyi's hand froze in mid-air.

"Wait."

Numeunyi said. There was a strange feeling in his voice.

"You guys have been fighting for Songlim all this time, right? Then reflect on the sacrifices you've made until now."

Jeokcheon smiled and replied.

"Then Songlim will somehow endure. We will show our determination and resolve."

Numeunyi nodded his head.

"Then let's test this belief. Show me how much you are willing to sacrifice for Songlim."

With those words, Numeunyi's hand swung down. With the sound of thunder in the sky, lightning rained down.

Eunyi and Yeomho did their best to dodge the lightning, but it flew straight towards them.

When the lightning struck Eunyi and Yeomho, they fell to the ground. The intense power of the lightning began to engulf their bodies.

I stood there, staring blankly at the scene. Then, without making a sound, I burst into laughter.

"This is the sacrifice you guys have made. Fighting and dying for Songlim."

And he approached and helped Gwangcheon stand up.

"Remember the brothers who sacrificed themselves for Songlim."

"Being unable to save him is regrettable, but it was Songlim, not the priests, who asked Gwangdo for help."

Tsutsutsuchi...

In that moment, a massive force gathered in Jeokcheon's grasp. It swiftly took shape and shot out like an arrow.

Not towards Yeomho, but towards the masked figures swinging their swords without any hesitation.

Gwaaaah!

The concentrated force unleashed from Jeokcheon's hand pierced through the heart of their formation. It roamed like a hungry dragon, devouring and incinerating everything it touched.

Whoosh!

For the first time, I saw a flicker of emotion in the indifferent eyes of the masked figures.

It was fear and agony.

"Scream!"

"Aaaah!"

Terrifying screams echoed as flames erupted.

Dozens of individuals stumbled away, their bodies ablaze. And the bodies of those who had already lost their lives numbered in the tens.

In the midst of that spectacle, the bodies of the masked figures were tossed aside, revealing the monks of Songlim and the leader who had joined the fray.

"It's not over yet!"

"Drive out the enemies!"

Shishishishi! Seoguk!

Jeokcheon, who had completely reversed the situation, looked at Yeomho with a chilling gaze.

"If you're going to kill, then kill. If not, get out of the way and don't imitate a pathetic fox."

"You... You wretched bastard!"

Sseaeeaak!

Yeomho continued to imitate the fox until the very end. He threw Jeokcheon away and immediately charged at the fox, no, the bear that had been hiding behind him.

Gwaaaah!

With a horrifying clash, bodies were swept away by the surging air pressure.

I, too, was thrown back, sliding down for about twenty steps. I managed to stabilize myself in the nearby forest, and then I leaped towards the two supreme experts engaged in a fierce battle.

Of course, Yeomho wasn't just standing there, spectating with a smirk.

Sahn!
Shiriririk! Pick!

His knee, as sturdy as a log, blocked my strike, causing a tingling sensation to resonate.

But that's enough.

Supreme and supreme. It was a gap that couldn't be bridged regardless of any luck that followed, but to me, it was not luck but a heavenly opportunity.

The fortune called the system.

"You're worthy opponents. In a one-on-one situation, it might be impossible, but even Yeomho is struggling to face Jeokcheon."

Eunyi's only mistake was underestimating my existence.

"Accept your defeat."

Yeomho's face turned red as if it would explode, looking at my smiling face.

"This damn blue brat!"

"This insolent fool!"

"Kraaah!"

Yeomho, who had pushed away Jeokcheon, rushed forward with anger.

"I'll kill you first!"

Ssaaeaaeak!

A powerful punch from a fist linked with martial power. If I were to take that attack with my bare body, I wouldn't come out unscathed either.

Stepping back, I grabbed the white back fur and swung it.

Kwang!

With a loud noise, the fist stopped. Yeomho's eyes widened like a burning lantern.

"Mannyeonhanchul?"

"Indeed, the most expensive weapons are the best. Isn't that right, Noya?"

Jeokcheon didn't answer. Instead, his white-gloved fist, stained with a pale color, was flying towards Yeomho.

Kkaaang!

The ground shook along with the noise. It was a direct hit from two fists, but the bones in the person's fist crumbled and burned.

Yeomho murmured with a face that went pale.

"H-How?"

"I thought you were all the same, assuming I had mastered Yeolyangji."

A indifferent voice. However, in Jeokcheon's eyes, there was molten lava.

The heat emanating from his entire body was incomparable to the flames of Yeomho.

Yeomho muttered in disbelief.

"Hwawang..."

"That's right. Nobu is the seventeenth successor of the Yolhwamun, Hwawang Jeokcheon."

"This can't be... cough!"

I flew towards Yeomho, spitting out blood, trying to escape.

"Where do you think you're going?"

Kwajik!

With a powerful kick, I shattered his instep, digging deep into the ground. Blood splattered along with Yeomho's pained groan.

In the next moment, two beams of light pierced his abdomen, causing him to stagger.

Ssaaeaaeak!

The difference in cultivation level also brings a difference in power, but the name of the martial art is the same.

"Myeoryeomsingwon (Destruction Flame Divine Fist)."

Pueok!

The formidable aura that surrounded his whole body, like an iron armor, was shattered. Blood spewed from Yeomho's mouth as his jaw snapped open.

"Kueeeak!"

Even though they were both top-notch martial artists, there was a clear difference between them. Exclaiming in anger, Yumho's face turned red as if it would explode.

"This damn punk!"

"This damn coward!"

"Kraaack!"

Yumho, who shook off Jeokcheon Gang, rushed forward with determination.

"I'll kill you first!"

Wham!

If he were to take a powerful attack with his bare body, even I wouldn't be safe.

Taking a step back, I grabbed Baekyeom, who was on my back, and swung him.

Bang!

With a loud noise, my fist came to a stop. Yumho's eyes widened like lanterns.

"Manneyunhancheol?"

"Indeed, expensive weapons are the best. Don't you agree, Noya?"

Jeokcheon Gang didn't reply. Instead, his white-lined fist was flying towards Yumho.

Crash!

With a loud noise, the ground shook. Although both fists collided, Yumho's knuckles twisted and burned, unlike Jeokcheon Gang's fist.

Yumho muttered with a bewildered expression, "How...?"

"I thought you had mastered the Yeongyang discipline?"

An indifferent voice. But in Jeokcheon Gang's eyes, there was simmering lava.

Heat that surpassed the flames of Yumho emanated from his entire body, pressing in from all directions.

Yumho groaned, sounding like a whimper.

"Hwawang..."

"Yes, I am Jeokcheon Gang, the successor of the Seventeen Generations of Hwawang, the Flame King."

"This can't be... Kulk!"

As Yumho tried to escape, vomiting blood, I launched myself towards him.

"Nowhere to run."

Thud!

My powerful kick shattered the arch of his foot, burying it deep into the ground. Yumho's agonized groan and splatters of blood followed.

In the next moment, two flashes struck his abdomen, causing intense pain.

Crash!

Although the power differed due to their levels, the name of the martial arts technique was the same.

'Myeolyeomsin-gwon (Fireside Forest Destroyer).'

Puff!

The protective energy surrounding Yumho's body, like an armor, shattered. Blood sprayed from his broken nose.

"Kueaak!"

Both highly skilled, but the difference was evident.

Yumho, severely injured and gasping for breath, looked up at Jeokcheon Gang with a cold gaze.

"This is as far as your luck goes."

"Cough... Wait a moment."

"We don't have a reason or time for that."

"I will tell you everything! Everything about Amcheon... about Amcheon-"

"Didn't Noya tell you not to pretend to be a fox?"

Shiik! Pic!

Without a hint of hesitation, Jeokcheon Gang's hand moved swiftly. Yumho's head disappeared, and his lifeless body fell.

I wiped the blood off my face and spoke.

"Wouldn't it have been better to spare him?"

"You can't reveal important secrets to a fool like him."

"But still..."

"A fool like him can't be allowed to know important secrets."

"But still..."

"Gom has died, so now it's time to catch the fox."

Jeokcheon Gang turned his head with ambiguous words. A few dozen steps away, an old man stood upright, watching us.

In his hand, a short staff emitted a green light.

"Nokok Fire Staff!"

"Umgye (Ke) Hansu. The next one is him."

In an instant, as if understanding his words, Hansu's new form shot forward at a dazzling speed.
