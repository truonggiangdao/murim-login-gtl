"Cheong Sohyeop. Cheong Sohyeop, wake up."

Clang! Clang!

"Hmm."

Cheongpung groaned and opened his eyes.

Someone was vigorously shaking him awake. It was strange to be woken up like this, and he felt a peculiar sensation.

"Ah, this is why people dislike being disturbed during their meal."

Cheongpung opened his mouth with a slight groan.

"What's happening?"

Clang! Clang!

"I'm awake."

Clang! Clang!

"I'm awake..."

Clang!

After delivering one final blow, the hand finally stopped.

The young man with a weary face opened his mouth with a stern expression.
"I see you're awake. Do you remember who I am?"

"It's been a long time. Sir Hyukmujin."

Hyukmujin let out a sigh.

"So you remember."

"Yes. I didn't expect to meet like this though."

In Cheongpung's mind, Hyukmujin was remembered as a good person.

But when someone you haven't seen in a year starts hitting you, even someone like Cheongpung feels hurt.

"If I made you feel uncomfortable, I apologize. I was reminded of the money I lost."

"Huh?"

"No, I apologize for my rude behavior due to the urgency of the situation."

"I see."

In that case, it was understandable.

Cheongpung glanced around. People were running around and shouting in all directions.

"Is it a festival?"

"...A festival, you say?"

"No?"

"No."

Hyukmujin firmly replied and explained the situation in general.

The Law King Gyeongdo was found dead, and the prime suspect is...

"Jorichu, you mean?"

"Yes. Sangseunggeom Jorichu. That's the one. The exact identity is unknown, but the prevailing opinion is that he is an assassin sent by Magyo."

"Magyo..."

That name was heard several times through Lady Geomseong's mouth. It was a place where rumors of heinous assassinations that once stained the whole world gathered.

But if Jorichu, the assassin from Magyo, was the culprit, Cheongpung unknowingly shook his head.

"No."

"Are you sure...?"

Hyukmujin asked with a perplexed expression.

"I remember everything. Even until the last moment, when I felt helpless against an invincible opponent, fear, and the word 'death' came to mind for the first time in my life."

"It was terrifying. Truly."

Cheongpung's lips, which had been tightly sealed for a moment, opened.

"He's my friend."

"Pardon?"

"That person is my friend. It's true."

"Cheong Sohyeop!"

Surprised, Hyukmujin hastily looked around, checking if anyone was paying attention to them.

As soon as he confirmed that no one was interested in them, he let out a suppressed voice.

"Are you insane? To call that person your friend, Jorichu, who is already a well-known figure in the martial world..."

Even if Cheongpung claimed to be his friend, he could receive disapproval from the martial world, even if he was a disciple raised by Geomseong.

"Do not mention it again. Do you understand?"

"But..."

Cheongpung, who was about to say something, closed his mouth at Hyukmujin's gaze.

"That man is a madu. I'm not sure what cunning trick he used to gain your favor, but please know that it was all a disguise to assassinate Gyeongdo."

"Are you certain? Did anyone witness him killing?"

"All the

 evidence is conclusive. A task force has already been formed to capture him, and thousands of troops have gathered to rescue Soryeom and stop the evil plans of Magyo."

"Soryeom..."

Cheongpung gently closed his eyes.

It was a pitch-black darkness, and the faces of Jintae-gyeong and Jongrichu flashed before Cheongpung's eyes one after another. The decision was not difficult.

"I'll go first."

Seokbe!

When Hyukmujin asked in a puzzled manner, Cheongpung had already gone far ahead.

In the direction his footsteps were heading was Sungsan, known as one of the five peaks of Oak. It was supposed to be a place of scenic beauty and tranquility, but it was now stained with blood and screams.

"Ahh!"

"Kill them all without mercy."

Swoosh! Swoosh!

With every swing of their swords, blood splattered from various places.

In the peaceful Baekjung in broad daylight, hundreds of masked figures suddenly appeared and continued their slaughter with indifferent gazes.

"Protect the worshippers! Do not retreat under any circumstances!"

The Sohnims with marks on their foreheads tried to stop them, but the situation didn't improve.

In a field where facing off against exceptional martial artists was overwhelming, they also had to protect young disciples who hadn't mastered martial arts and numerous worshippers.

"What is happening?"

"Kyaah!"

No one expected such a thing to happen today. Who dared to invade the grounds of Soryeomsa, one of the Taesanbukdu of the Wulin?

During the chaos where the monks were being pushed back by the brutal and treacherous masked figures, someone made their presence known.

"These fools! How dare they invade this place!"

With a thunderous cry, the figure revealed themselves to be Noseung of Ocheokdangu.

Sparks flew from the eyes of Noseung as he glared at the masked figures staining the grounds of Soryeomsa with blood.

"May the power of the devil be with you!"

The explosive energy released from Noseung's hands swept through the front lines.

Gwaah!

The masked figures, who had been charging towards Noseung, were engulfed in his energy and met their demise.

It was a devastating sight to see dozens of skilled martial artists collapsing in an overwhelming display of power.

However...

"By the order of the Heavenly Master, kill the enemy."

"Follow the command. Kill them all."

The hundreds of masked figures didn't stop.

They showed no hesitation or wavering. It was as if they were possessed, muttering and swinging their swords.

Suk! Suk! Suk!

As the masked figures continued their relentless assault, the expression on Noseung's face turned stern.

"They are not human. They are demons in themselves."

Even the experienced warriors who had emerged from the Jingmadaejun were overwhelmed when faced with such a situation. For the young ones witnessing such horror for the first time, fear gripped their bodies.

But those who didn't retreat were driven by a sense of duty, faced with the evil that stood before themâ€”the disciples of Baggwi and Daebyeol with the power of Unbreakable Will.

"I never expected such a day to come."

Noseung sighed inwardly.

In the previous Jingmadaejun, it was Soryeom who stood at the forefront, shedding more blood than anyone else. It was a noble sacrifice that saved the Wulin world, but it came at the cost of losing many elders and martial artists. And now, the sacrifice of that time had turned into today's tragedy.

"Why did this have to happen when the leader is absent?"

There was no other choice. He was the only one who could protect Soryeomsa at this moment.

Noseung, along with Gyeongchun, let out a sigh of determination.

"This is Soryeomsa

!"

Although his name was overshadowed by the reputation of Gyeongdo, he had reached a transcendent state in martial arts due to his relentless pursuit of the Way.

"Come at me, all of you!"

Gwaah!

With an overwhelming power imbued with Unbreakable Will, the momentum swept through in all directions.

"Oh ho, the White Tiger Divine Fist?"

"Seeing that despicable martial art again."

Two voices rang out, cutting through the air as they slowly entered the grounds. And at the same time, the masked figures, who had been lowering their swords and retreating calmly, froze in their tracks.

"So, it's you guys?"

With a smirk on his face, Gyeongcheone responded to the red-bearded old man's words, his voice full of contempt.

"Yes, it is I."

"The despicable madus of Cheonsan, I presume."

"Cheonsan madu, half right and half wrong, but let's leave it at that."

Gyeongcheone was impressed.

"So, the magyos... or should I say, the Lawless Devils?"

"What does that matter? As long as you know that I am the one who will tear off that noisy head of yours."

The old man with the demeanor of a scholar chuckled calmly in response.

"Yeomho, are you planning to handle it?"

"Of course. After witnessing the White Tiger Divine Fist, I can't just let it pass."

"This guy, you should control your temper."

"I'll think about it later. For now, I want to kill that fat man."

Gyeongcheone alternated his gaze between the two old men, Yeomho and Hansu.

Yeomho, that was his name. And the immense momentum emanating from the two contrasting old men.

"Could it be that you guys..."

Yeomho let out a wild laughter and nodded his head.

"Now that you've finally realized. You're still a young one. Are you that brat, the Lawful Priest, the youngest disciple of the Great Law King?"

Tsu-iyaji.

"Judging by your reaction, it seems to be true. Hansu, what was the name of the minion you killed last?"

"Baekgong."

When Gyeongcheone heard the Dharma name of Saseok, who perished in the previous Jingmadaejun, his fists trembled.

"It's unmistakable. It's them."

How could he not recognize them? Yeomho and Hansu's names, and the titles of the remnants of Soryeom who killed countless disciples.

"Yum-yang Twin Devils."

It was a tale from the distant and dark past.

The two madus who ruled over the southern tropical rainforest and the northern Daeseolsan had come to the central region, drenching the world in blood. The grand-scale battle unfolded to exterminate them, but it was interrupted by the invasion of the magyos.

The two surviving madus joined forces with the magyos and wreaked havoc in the Jingmadaejun, leaving a tremendous catastrophe in their wake.

"Yum-yang Twin Devils... It's been a while since I heard about someone else's affairs."

"It was a memorable time. Rarely have we enjoyed an opponent as much."

Remembering the horrific past, Yeomho scratched his head.

"No, not anymore. I prefer the present."

"Well, we couldn't make it to Hanam back then."

"But now, there are no more Hanams."

"The Shiwang, the Samsung, they're hardly around anymore."

Yeomho smiled as his eyes flickered.

"I guess you're right. It was a nostalgic remark. However..."

A passionate voice interjected.

"All of you, including you, will perish here. That's our judgment."

As Yeomho and Hansu spoke, the masked figures, expressionless, took a step forward.

The sound of unsheathed swords filled the Soryeomsa with anticipation.

Gyeongcheone felt a foreboding sensation as he gazed at the scene.

"Execution... Is it true?"

But the tremor soon faded, and determination filled his eyes.

"I won't allow it!"

Steadying himself, Gyeongcheone clenched his fists.

"I didn't expect to face both Yum and Yang at the same time. Come, you damn madus!"

"Hahahahaha! This guy, for a monk, he has a rough mouth. I like it because it suits my taste."

With a burst of energy, Yeomho shattered the silence and stepped forward.

"Unfortunately, you'll suffice as a single opponent. Hansu, I have more important matters to attend to."

"Yes, very important matters indeed."

Hansu smiled and took a stance, facing Gyeongcheone.

"Then step aside, will you? I have to go to Myeonbyeokdong."

Myeonbyeokdong.

As those words escaped Hansu's lips, Gyeongcheone felt his heart skip a beat. It was a place where the Lawless existed. And...

Finally realizing the purpose of his enemies, Gyeongcheone roared, unleashing his inner power.

"Whatever it takes, stop them!"

"To stop? That won't be enough."

With a wicked smile, the Yum-yang Twin Devils unsheathed their swords.

The eerie presence emanated from their entire beings, as if they had returned to those days over fifty years ago.

"Kill me."

Tsu-aeeeek!
