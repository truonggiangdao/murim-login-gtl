The rain of countless blades and arrowheads poured from all directions.

Without even needing to think about how to move, the image naturally formed in my mind. And as I thought, my hands moved.

Swish, a blue flame encircled the edge of my spear, drawing a semicircle.

Whoosh!

Arrows and weapons caught in its trajectory split apart like tofu.

The spear itself was as strong and sharp as eternal steel, capable of shattering fortified defenses. And with a spear technique incorporated, it yielded the expected results.

Of course, it wouldn't be the same for those bastards.

"This!"

A Black Hunter, with his own sword melted into his weapon of Inferno Arts (%0), stared at his severed blade and exhaled breathlessly. He was the closest one, my first target.

Crack!

With strength that could crush rocks and iron bars, I clenched my hand around his forearm, and his flesh crumbled while bones protruded.

"Krrraaaack!"

I had memorized the appearances of those who had attacked the stronghold. I gazed at the face of the Black Hunter, writhing in agony.

"At least it's not a woman."

"Die!"

With a venomous shout, a dagger sliced across his throat. Despite the excruciating pain, there was no hesitation in my hand.

This wasn't a raid; it was the movement of a skilled killer.

"By facing these bastards using common sense, I realize once again how damn stupid they are."

I evaded the dagger with a smirk. At the same time, I grabbed hold of his remaining arm and pulled with all my might.

No, I tore it off.

Crunch!

The sound of his jaw dislocated due to the severe pain, leaving his mouth hanging open.

I kicked the trembling back of the man whose limbs were shaking uncontrollably. Blood gushed out like a fountain from the severed section, accompanied by the gasping breaths that seemed on the verge of snapping at any moment.

I threw the detached arms onto the grassy field.

"One down."

2
Suddenly, a heavy silence descended on all sides.

The Black Hunters, witnessing their comrades of similar rank being dispatched in an instant, stopped in their tracks. Im Young-jun, who had been observing the situation from behind, twitched his eyebrow.

"So, there was some trust after all."

"Yup, I came because I had it. But it seems like you guys don't."

"Jin Tae-kyung, you fucking bastard..."

"That's why I said you should have listened when I spoke nicely. Because of you and the other two, this poor guy had to fight alone and couldn't even scratch himself."

His dry voice swept across the surroundings. With every gaze that brushed over me, a wave of anger and confusion mingled.

Reading the atmosphere, Im Young-jun opened his eyes wide and shook his head.

"What are you doing, you bastards! Even if you have to shower them with potions, keep them alive and don't back down!"

I blinked my eyes. For a moment, I wondered what I had heard.

Ah, right. Potions.

"If your limbs are flying around, you should have at least a high-grade potion. You guys must be loaded."

"It's not a waste to think of it as the money spent on removing a big obstacle. We should have eliminated you from the start... You've been arrogant since receiving the order."

"Is it okay to reveal that you have someone backing you up? Are you inviting assassination?"

"Assassination?"


A smirk appeared on Im Yeongjun's lips.

"Well, our role is to carry out these deadly acts. And you're going to die here anyway."

"Well, let's put that aside for now. There's something I've been curious about."

I asked sincerely,

"The potion you guys use, does it have the power to revive the dead? Or do you carry around a few extra lives?"

Giggle.

Daedam confidently replied, raising his spear. The neck of the Black Hunter, who had been groaning under his feet, was severed.

I kicked the severed head that had been separated from the body and rolled it towards them.

"Try to save him."

Swish.

Without hesitation, I flicked my hand.

The two black hunters staggered and then collapsed with a thud.

The decapitated heads of the corpses, unable to withstand the force embedded in the daggers, had half of them blown away.

"Ah, I was trying to neatly pierce the forehead, but I couldn't control my strength."

Swoosh.

The air around us seemed to tremble.

Im Yeongjun's smirk disappeared without a trace. The eyes of the remaining twenty-five Black Hunters showed fear and confusion.

"H-how...?"

"What the hell...?"

Muffled groans echoed from all around. It was an experience they had never encountered before.

Hunters who hunted monsters, and Black Hunters created to hunt those hunters.

Murder, abduction, threats, and all sorts of dirty work were handled as the guild's problem solvers. But they never imagined themselves being hunted down like this.

And especially not being overwhelmed so one-sidedly.

I placed my hand on top of the headless corpse.

"Damn Black Blade bastards."

No, their mindset is even lower than Black Blades.

At least those guys might have prepared themselves to die from a knife in some dark alley someday.

"Who... what exactly are you?"

Im Yeongjun's voice was dry as he stared at me.

"I already know, so why bother asking?"

His gaze lost its edge.

"You deceived people so easily. It's definitely not the skill of someone who has only killed once or twice."

"Hunting beasts is not considered murder. It's usually called slaughter."

Step by step, as I slowly walked, the Black Hunters who had surrounded me took a step back.

Even if they were insensitive, they must have sensed it. That I'm not just a simple Grade 2 Hunter.

A different aura and the smell of vampire.

Im Yeongjun opened his mouth with a stern expression.

"The creation of a Grade 2 Hunter was a warning. It was an order from above."

"I didn't really like that method of warning. Not at all."

"I understand your intention. Stop here."

Selrangbae added, "The next time, it could be more than that."

~

"Aren't you worried about your mother and younger brother?"

For a moment, I was speechless.

As Im Yeongjun's footsteps approached slowly but relentlessly, even his voice carried a hint of strength.

"You can see the difference between superiors and outsiders. I can be a stepping stone for you."

"A... stepping stone."

"You just have to give up one thing. Live not as Grade 2 Hunter Jin Taekyeong, but as civilian Jin Taekyeong. Of course, a sufficient price will be paid for that."

I looked into Im Yeongjun's eyes, subtly tense. On one hand, there was Iri's eye, eagerly looking for an opportunity.

After a brief silence, a soft voice slipped through my lips.

"A stepping stone. That sounds good."

Just as Im Yeongjun's mouth was about to curl into a bitter smile, I calmly continued.

"Since it's a stepping stone, I'll just pass by gracefully and brightly. I'll find out who's on the other side of the river when the time comes."

Sigh.

There is no compromise. They have crossed the line and are already my enemies.

The ways of the modern world and the martial world. I carefully weighed both options, but... today, I will choose the latter.

"And you, kid. When you make such a proposal, speak with a more trustworthy gaze."

I heard his shout as I planted my feet firmly on the ground. I lowered my spear towards the Black Hunters rushing towards me.

Swish!

The spear struck, imbued with the power of Samseong.

Enhanced magic shattered, and the tower shield crumbled into pieces. The tank hiding behind the shield stared at me in astonishment.

Whoosh!

The blade of the White Flame burst out from the front of his chest. The mage, who was behind the sturdy shield, hastily took a step back.

Slash!

At the same time as I flicked my hand, a dagger pierced his occiput. But it's not over yet.

"You're dea--"

Shiiik!

The three blades swept through with a fierce sound, targeting the neck, chest, and shoulder. The faint glow indicated the presence of a Grade 2 Hunter without a doubt.

Swish!

I pulled out the spear from the tank's lifeless chest and swung it around.

In a lightning-fast speed, the three swords shattered and one of them collapsed, clutching his throat.

As the splattered blood flipped in the air, I wiped off the bloodstains on my clothes with my sleeve.

Shiiik! Crack!

I jerked my head. A small lance, curved and heavy enough to be called a small spear, grazed past me and embedded itself in the stone wall behind me.

Crash!

A pile of dirt hit the ground, with a solid rock deeply stuck in it. Truly an incredible force.

"These guys have been getting on my nerves since earlier."

Even these guys had positions just like regular hunters. They had tanks, melee dealers, and even ranged dealers couldn't be overlooked.

From the beginning, I noticed three archers who hadn't come out of the mansion and were constantly pulling their bows on the second-floor window.

Shishishish!

Just as I was about to swing down the spear to put an end to it, a black shadow emerged like a ghost and aimed for my nose with an unexpected force.

Shiririk!

Fast and accurate. Clearly, a melee dealer with exceptional stealth skills. I didn't know how many I had killed with this method until now, but one thing was certain.

"I chose the wrong person today."

Terteting!

I skillfully twisted the spear's blade. The iron spear that was originally supposed to be swept away like a falling leaf changed its trajectory and struck the body of the Black Hunter who was trying to stab me with a dagger.

Pupupik!

"Damn it!"

The Black Hunter, who was suddenly hit by an arrow in mid-air, made a thud sound and fell to the ground.

I pulled out the iron spear that was embedded in his upper body. With a dull thud, his body stopped trembling. At the same time, I forcefully shook my hand in the direction where the arrow had come from.

Ssaeeak! Thud!

The iron spear imbued with power did its job perfectly.

It returned to its original target faster and stronger than when I first shot it.

The three archers who were preparing the next arrow were met with their deaths almost simultaneously.

"These crazy bastards...!"

The approaching enemies halted their steps upon witnessing that sight. The hands holding their weapons trembled noticeably.

They had no choice but to react that way after witnessing more than ten of their comrades being killed in the blink of an eye.

But I had no intention of stopping here.

Shiririk! Swish!

The enemies rushed at me, and I swung, slashed, and struck. Blood mist filled the air as arms, legs, and even heads flew in all directions.

"Kraaack!"

Suddenly, screams erupted from all sides. Amidst the fear and chaos, someone's forest-bound knuckles emerged and struck my spear.

Gwaang!

"Retreat into the mansion!"

For a brief moment, I chuckled at Im Young-jun's shout.

"Did you set up trap magic circles?"

"Shut up!"

Hwooooong!

Even though he claimed to be the leader, he was still the weakest.

No, at this level, even in the martial arts world, one could be considered a pinnacle master.

"You know how to handle energy."

One reason why hunters felt significantly inferior to the martial arts world was their proficiency in energy manipulation.

However, Im Young-jun and the other Black Hunters, including him, demonstrated much more efficient movements compared to regular hunters.

"Well, even if I see it, it's just this level."

There's always a wall that cannot be overcome no matter how one flies or crawls.

I aimed my fist towards the knuckles.

And he fiercely met it head-on, clenching his teeth.

Gwang!

Single Strike (-98). The knuckles broke.

Gwang!

Single Strike (-88). Im Young-jun's fist crumpled.

Gwaang!

Triple Strike (=). A split second of the Myeolmyeoksin Fist struck his shoulder. Flesh melted, and bones were exposed. Im Young-jun, with one shoulder completely devoured by Hwaryeong, vomited blood and retreated far away.

"Team Leader!"

However, he still had remaining subordinates.

The Black Hunters who had been waiting until the end quickly lifted Im Young-jun's body and flew into the mansion.

Kong. The door closed as a translucent film layered the mansion, sending chills down my spine.

"A defensive magic?"

Undoubtedly, it was a very powerful defensive magic. It felt even stronger than what Kim Jibsa had demonstrated in the past.

However, I didn't stop my steps.

In just one step, I stood in front of the door and unleashed a strike towards the dozens of layers of defensive barriers.

"Shooting Strike (048)."

With all my power, the Myeolcheon Fist struck the defensive barriers.

Like an unknown cliff in Mount Soongsan, the Myeolcheon Fist shattered and destroyed everything that stood in its way.

Gwaaaaah!

With a thunderous roar, the defensive barriers shattered into pieces. The roof was blown away, and the walls turned into rubble.

Beyond the melted front door, frozen enemies came into view.

In the center of them stood Im Young-jun.

His trembling lips, soaked in blood, uttered a groaning-like word.

"What... What are you... =?"

I boldly replied, "A monster. Just like you."

Team Leader Choi had said it before. This world is a place where monsters roam.

So, I made up my mind. Occasionally, I'll become a monster too.

Just like today.

"Have you ever heard of the 'Root Crushing Nightfall' (Shu###bam)?"

It didn't take long for Im Young-jun's expression to change.
