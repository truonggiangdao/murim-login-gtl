"Park Jihoon, you damn bastard." The voice that was about to continue through the receiver abruptly cut off. Even though I couldn't see, it was enough to convey the bewilderment and turmoil the person on the other side was feeling right now.

"What are you doing? When someone calls, you should answer," I said.

Not long after, a response came.

"Is it you?"

"Yeah, it's me, you bastard," I replied.

The agitated voice flowed out through the lips. My blood rushed through my body, and my heart pounded like a drum. But my mind remained as cold as ice, as if I had already anticipated this situation deep inside.

"I had a feeling, but I couldn't believe it."

The number twenty-eight that came out of that guy's mouth was enough to turn suspicion into certainty. The only thing I was curious about was whose orders he was following and how deeply involved he was.

"Did you send those bastards?"

A low and gentle voice responded boldly.

"Yeah, I did. If that's the case."

"Why? Did you think I'd back down?"

Look at this guy.

Laughter escaped me at his shameless attitude.

"Who did you hear it from? Lim Young Joon? Well, he's the only one. I thought he was the only one who couldn't keep his mouth shut... Looks like I misjudged him."

I clicked my tongue and said with a cold tone.

"That moron. I didn't ask him to handle it."

"What's wrong with a little shit like you? The one at fault is the guy who strained himself, exposing his ass in public. But you..."

Thunk.

The face of the team leader, who struggled in my grip, turned blue.

"After breaking bones, have you thought about how you're going to clean up the mess?"

"Well, this situation was unexpected... I hope you didn't handle it without considering the aftermath."

"Yeah, it's about that. I have something to show you."

"What?"

"Can you handle me?"

An instant of silence passed. One second, two seconds, three seconds.

And at the end of that brief silence, there was a chilling and sharp voice that I had never heard before.

"If you take another step from there, both you and the Peace Guild will be finished."

...

"It's not too late. Stop escalating this further and come out. Let's finish it here."

Hearing those words, it suddenly occurred to me that the principles governing the world were not much different from those of battle.

The one who seizes the advantage relentlessly pursues, while the one harboring fear retreats first.

And I knew the essence of that fear he possessed.

"A Black Hunter."

The existence of Black Hunters, who can be considered illegal mercenaries of a large guild, had a grip on Park Jihoon's ankle. The thought of it made the corners of my mouth curl up.

"Finish it?"

"Yeah."

"Who's deciding?"

Well...

"You guys started it first. I'll decide where it ends."

Behind the receiver, Park Jihoon's breath faltered.

"Damn. I knew you were stupid, but you're beyond my expectations."

"The outcome will be beyond your expectations too. Look forward to it, you bastard."

And that moment arrived.

Bang.

"19th floor."

With the mechanical sound, the tightly closed elevator doors slid open.

High ceilings and wide corridors. Dozens of people could be seen moving between them.

Among them, a few pairs of eyes naturally turned towards us. And their mouths immediately fell open.

"T-Team leader?"

"There! Who the hell..."

Instead of answering, I threw the team leader at them. A hunter who was approaching with a staff collided with the team leader, creating a big commotion.

Simultaneously, an employee sitting at the desk pressed the emergency button with a scream.

Wee-eee-eee-eeeng!

"Emergency! Emergency!"

"Intruders! Team 1, arm up!"

Amidst the chaotic noise, Park Jihoon's final words struck a chord.

"Yeah, go ahead. Give it a try."

Thump, thump, thump...

I tucked the team leader's phone, which had been disconnected, into my pocket. When I reached into my pocket again, instead of a phone, I held two short swords.

"Give it a try, huh?"

Well, I'm up for it.

"Who's there?"

"Disarm yourselves! If you don't want to die, do it now!"

The elite hunters of the Myeongdong Guild, armed to the teeth, surrounded me in a semicircle.

Behind me was the elevator. And there was only one person standing there, murmuring like a plaster cast.

"This must be a dream. It has to be a dream."

I half-glanced at him, my mind partially gone, and spoke.

"What phone are you using?"

"S-Smartphone 25."

"Oh, the Apple one, right?"

"Yes, yes, that's correct."

"Take it out and record a video."

He paused, about to take out his phone.

"Yes, yes? I'm sorry, but what did you say?"

"You said you're using a Smartphone 25. The video quality is much better than mine, so it'd be better to record with yours."

"W-What are you talking about?"

He stammered, not taking out his phone.

At that moment, the fallen team leader suddenly jumped up and shouted.

"What are you waiting for? Kill these bastards right now!"

"Team leader, isn't that person Jin Taekyung, the hunter? What's going on all of a sudden..."

"I'll take responsibility for it."

Regardless of which guild it is, Team 1 is always the symbol and the best of that guild. If it's Team 1 of the Myeongdong Guild, which is consistently ranked in the top 10 in the country, they are undoubtedly the pros among pros. They are no different from living combat machines.

"This is an order from higher-ups. Treat them as monsters and engage in combat."

With the team leader's clear instruction, the gazes of dozens of pairs of eyes calmed down.

Five tower shields on the front lines simultaneously slammed into the marble floor without any error.

Bang!

"Formation!"

In the midst of peaceful daily life, the urban buildings transformed into a battlefield.

※ ※ ※

"What am I seeing?"

Im Min-soo, a hunter in the Myeongdong Guild's security team, blinked his eyes.

The scene unfolding before him was surreal.

Boom! Crash!

Tower shields as sturdy as armored vehicles shattered, and the tanker flew off into the distance as if struck by a giant's hammer.

In the narrow gap created for just one person, Inyeong, agile and swift, plunged in.

And...

Shriiing! Thud! Thud!

"Graaah!"

"Ugh!"

The shields shattered with a burst of light. The calf tendons of the tankers, who were rushing forward, were cleanly cut.

"How on earth..."

An attack that couldn't even be seen properly.

With a blink of an eye, two people fell, and with another blink, several more collapsed.

Inyeong, the young man wearing a gray hoodie, left a trail of blood and overflowing screams with each step he took.

"Block, block it!"

"DPS!"

The frontline that the tankers were holding collapsed as soon as the battle began. Five blades swung vigorously toward Jin Taekyung, who was taking steps forward.

Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh!

The shoulders, chest, and legs. Three aimed for the upper body, and two aimed for the lower body. An unavoidable attack if not avoided.

"It's over!"

At the moment someone shouted with exhilaration, the dagger held in Jin Taekyung's hand blurred like mist.

Kakakakam!

The five blades that everyone believed would hit accurately swung into thin air.

Those who held the handle of the dagger looked at Jin Taekyung with eyes full of astonishment. The fingers that couldn't overpower the force and burst open were splattered with blood.

"What... is this?"

"It can't be!"

In response to the outcry, Jin Taekyung replied with a blunt voice.

"It worked?"

Swoosh!

A straight line was drawn horizontally.

An attack that couldn't be avoided or seen.

And in the trajectory of that attack, there were five hunters who had just attempted to block.

Choi-aack!

Through the hunters who fell while spewing a fountain of blood from their chests, a beam of light pierced through.

Ssaaaeaaak! Tuk!

The arrowhead stopped at the edge of Jin Taekyung's chest.

It was an urgent hunter who had carefully shot the arrow with mana.

However, what blocked it wasn't a shield coated with various spells or a sharp sword.

Thunk.

Jin Taekyung, who snapped the arrow shaft with two fingers, flicked his hand.

The arrow that had come with a terrifying piercing power broke through three defensive spells and lodged itself between the owner's shoulders.

Fff Fff

"If I shoot another arrow, I'll turn your balls into minced meat."

Thud.

"If anyone else doesn't want to turn into a pair of testicles, step back. It's annoying to control my strength, too."

You controlled your strength?

The hunters from Team 1 felt an eerie sensation as if they were possessed. It was hard to believe that in the time it takes to drink a glass of cold water, Jin Taekyung had incapacitated a dozen or more people. And now, he claims that this was him holding back his power.

At that moment, the same thought crossed everyone's mind.

"What kind of extraordinary being is he?"

They were no ordinary individuals. They were the finest hunters from the Myeongdong Guild, veterans with years of experience ranging from 8 to over 20 years. They had earned their place here with exceptional skills, and their pride soared high.

However, until today, before encountering Jin Taekyung, they had never experienced such a feeling.

"Please be polite and use honorifics when addressing us, senior members. We feel compelled to break the ice and get to know you better, but we believe there is no direct correlation here."

Jin Taekyung, dressed casually in sweatpants and a gray hoodie, spoke, but no one paid him any attention.

He had already shown his power, leaving an indelible mark on everyone's mind.

"So, let's clear the way."

Even the seasoned veterans who had fought countless battles at the gate felt an overwhelming pressure closing in on them.

It was a primal fear unlike anything they had experienced before, even against the most formidable monsters.

"A monster. He's a real monster."

Thump. Thump.

The monster approached them.

Unconsciously, the hunters found themselves stepping aside to make way for him.

"Burning Hands (800108 The3009)!"

With a burst, a flaming hand engulfed Jin Taekyung.

It was a fire magic that could melt even solid rocks, yet the gigantic hand made of mana vanished without a trace the moment it touched Jin Taekyung's palm.

"Ma-Magic?"

"It's called Flame Manifestation. Pretty useful, isn't it?"

The leader of Team 1, witnessing Jin Taekyung's palm covered in azure flames, widened his eyes in surprise.

Jin Taekyung, being silently observed by him, didn't utter a word, but his dry lips curled into a smile.

It was like a predator discovering its forgotten prey.

"Oh, you're the exception, as I mentioned before."

Shhhing!

Jin Taekyung's body twisted like a ghostly apparition.

However, the Team 1 leader was also a highly skilled combat magician, leading the Myeongdong Guild's finest team. Despite his confusion, he reacted swiftly.

"Blink (8100)!"

Blink is a teleportation spell that allows you to instantly move to any location within a 100-meter range, regardless of obstructed vision.

"If I were to unleash an attack spell from behind, no matter how agile and evasive he is... Blink magic!"

Using Blink magic, the Team 1 leader moved behind Jin Taekyung and was immediately seized by a sensation as if the world had stopped.

Jin Taekyung's clear and deep black eyes were right in front of him.

Thud. The still warm palm pressed against his shoulder.

"Why are you so surprised?"

But...

"Don't roll your eyes as if you can see the direction through eye movements."

Was it because he predicted the direction from the movement of his gaze?

No, it wasn't just that.

The Team 1 leader trembled as if struck by lightning.

"His movements... they're faster than my Blink magic."

Who exactly is this guy?

And what kind of monster did Park Jihoon, the Myeongdong Guild, provoke?

With a trembling voice, he uttered his final prepared incantation.

"Po-Poison (0061900)."

Ah, a green poisonous mist enveloped Jin Taekyung's face.

However, the Team 1 leader inwardly felt a sense of impending doom, as the monster once again proved its monstrous nature.

"Ah, the smell of flatulence."

A handsome forehead wrinkled.

The reaction to the Poison spell was all it took.

Reaching the pinnacle of the Toxic Blazing Demon (Scorchmaster 8), Jin Taekyung breathed out towards the frozen Team 1 leader.

Paralysis...

"Ugh."

The complexion of the Team 1 leader, who had ingested the poison, turned a shade of blue.

Jin Taekyung, gripping the paralyzed leader's back tightly as his entire body stiffened from the Paralysis Poison, looked around and asked.

"Park Jihoon, where is that bastard's office?"

With a hissing sound...

Ten fingers moved towards a single door.
