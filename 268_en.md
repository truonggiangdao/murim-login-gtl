The death of the Law King, Gyeongdo, and the mysterious bloodbath that occurred at the Sorig Temple, the sacred place of the Taesanbukduin School.

The voices of people spread faster than galloping horses.

Through the mouths of numerous witnesses, rumors spread like wildfire.

"Have you heard the news? The Murim people are surrounding Sungsan. There was a bloodbath at the Sorig Temple."

Hananseong, who was immersed in the festive atmosphere of the Seongra Daeyeon celebration, was taken aback. The old man recalled the chaos caused by the Maekyo in the world decades ago, while the young ones realized that the dusty past wars were becoming a reality.

"Maekyo has appeared. This is a big problem."

"According to the rumors, it wasn't the Maekyo but someone else who caused the incident."

"Are there other people capable of such acts besides the Maekyo?"

"I don't know the exact facts. I just heard it on my way here."

"I can't believe it. The leader of the attackers who assaulted the Sorig Temple is said to be the fearsome Eumyang Ssanggwe."

"Eumyang Ssanggwe? I heard it was the Maekyo himself."

"The Maekyo?"

Various words piled up, and the rumor spread like a snowball.

Amidst the truth and falsehood, it was natural for people's attention to be focused on one place.

The former territory of the Murim Alliance.

The place where the major and minor pillars of the Jungpa Murim were located.

"I've heard the stories. About Jongli Choo, no, Gyeomseong Ma Jonghak."

"Stay strong. In life, anything can happen."

"I also completely understand the situation. Phew... Anyway, it turned out like this. I heard about it when I received news from the leader."

"Really?"

"Why are you feeling strong?"

"Well, isn't it natural? The old sage used to say that pain becomes lighter when shared..."

Puh!

"Neungeok!"

Hyeokmujin, who was struck precisely on the back of the neck, bowed down with a sound of wind.

When I saw the exposed white nape, my hand instinctively reached out. My hand reached out.

Bang!

"Why are you feeling strong? Huh?"

"I-I was struck on the nape. Nape."

"As for me, my blood pressure rises because of you. My blood is flowing in reverse!"

Bang! Bang! Bang!

After stormily striking the back of the neck, I felt a little relieved in my gut.

This child is disturbing and causes trouble for others.

"The atmosphere is serious right now, so be careful with your words. Understand?"

Hyeokmujin mumbled, silenced.

I quietly looked out the window.

Despite the restless movements of people coming and going in all directions, there was no one who stood out, yet there was a tense atmosphere.

However, amidst all this, the sky was incredibly clear.

The events of the previous day didn't feel real at all. It all felt like a dream that lasted only one day.

The final breath of the Law King, Gyeongdo, and the blood-stained scene at the Sorig Temple passed by like a panorama, along with the appearance of the Eumyang Ssanggwe and Hyeolju, and the introduction of Gyeomseong Ma Jonghak.

"The problem is that this is just the prologue."

If it were a movie, it wouldn't be strange for the ending credits to start rolling at this timing. But this is not a prelude to a happy ending; it's an ominous foreshadowing.

Everyone felt an indescribable sense of crisis that could be felt through their skin.

"Something is changing.

The current heavens have already transformed into a giant gunpowder warehouse. While the Jungpa Murim may hold the fuse, the hands of the Amcheon have pebbles ready.

And just yesterday, the fuse ignited.

I still don't know the outcome of all these events, but I can imagine the process.

"A war is about to break out."

This war will be on a completely different scale than the Battle of Sansoseong. Even the higher-ups can't help but speculate about it.

The leadership of the Jungpa Murim had no time to spare for the resolution and deliberations of this incident.

"By the way, wasn't Jojangnim absent from the meeting yesterday?"

I nodded silently.

Although he couldn't compare to the Gupa-ilbang or the Odaese, Taewon Jingga was undeniably the loser of Sansoseong.

Especially since Sansoseong was where the Amcheon first revealed their true form, it was natural for the attention of the leadership to be focused there.

"What is it?"

"He asked about the Nejangro and Jeokpungdan. I answered within my knowledge."

"I can understand Nejangro, but what about Jeokpungdan?"

"Jeokpungdanju Pyungyang was associated with the Amcheon through the Jamnyeokdan (Ppal7)3)."

Hyukmu-jin is now a high-ranking member of the family, so he knows some of the circumstances. The existence of Jamnyeokdan and the Amcheon is the same.

"Were there any interesting stories?"

"It just came out. Anyway, the important news will be heard and relayed by the senior."

Without realizing it, a voice that had sunk between my lips flowed out.

"I can't bear to keep brooding alone."

My gaze, which had been staring out the window, naturally turned to a person.

An old man with a small stature lying on the bed as if in a deep sleep.

When I held his wrinkled hand, I could feel his pulse, and there were faint movements indicating breathing, but he still hadn't regained consciousness even after a day had passed.

"When will he wake up?"

"That's the problem. I don't know exactly."

"Wasn't there a legislator who went in under a false name?"

"He said he couldn't do anything. Since he wasn't seriously injured like the others, he said to observe for now."

Hwashingwi-mu (%Ppaeppapo). A divine skill that can be called the essence of the Yulhwamun.

It possesses tremendous power that can rival ten thousand warriors, but there is always a hefty price to pay for everything.

The old man, who had already surpassed the age of a hundred, no longer had the physical strength and vitality to withstand its aftermath.

I shook my head to dismiss the thought that had come to mind.

Let's put aside negative thoughts.

Gumsungdo and the legislator clearly stated that their lives were not in danger. Now the best course of action was to observe the Jeokcheon Gang.

"Was there anyone suspicious while I was away?"

The head of the Sorigsa was assassinated within the Murim Alliance. No one could guarantee their safety. Just as Jeokcheon Gang protected me from Hyeolju, I must also protect him.

Hyukmu-jin nodded with a confident expression.

"Jinryongdae has completely surrounded the headquarters. Don't worry."

"Jinryongdae? The elite force of Taewon Jingga?"

"Yes. The Sogaju-nim was also worried about the security of the enemy headquarters, so he assigned me. Who am I? I'm the

 commanding officer of Jinryongdae, Hyukmu-jin."

"Are you sure?"

I glanced up and down at him, then a melancholic gaze turned away.

The confident expression on Hyukmu-jin's face suddenly became gloomy.

"What's with that reaction just now?"

"Oh, it's nothing. I just thought that from now on, I shouldn't leave my post."

"Don't tell me you don't trust the skills of the current elite force, Jinryongdae?"

"Oh, no. It's not like that. Let's just forget about it."

Hyukmu-jin, who had been glaring at me with a disappointed look, suddenly stood up.

"Fine. I'll report to Sogaju-nim and withdraw."

"Oh, why are you saying that again? Are you going through puberty these days?"

"Because Jojangnim seemed so disappointed in what you said. Isn't this the first or second time? Huh?!"

"Lower your voice. Noya will wake up."

"It would be nice if he woke up."

Amidst my momentary loss for words, Hyukmu-jin walked towards the door with determination. It was evident that he wanted to stop someone from leaving. In times like these, I had to meet his expectations.

"Hey, where are you going?" Hyukmu-jin said confidently.

"It's fine. I can endure everything else, but I can't tolerate remarks that disregard my subordinates!"

"What?"

"Why again?"

"You didn't expect such words to come out of your mouth. You've really grown arrogant. You won't need a circumcision surgery."

"...I sincerely apologize."

"Alright, alright. Sit down. Relax and have a drink."

"No, thank you."

"Heh, we have a lot of Mu-jins. Making me repeat myself."

After hesitating, Hyukmu-jin quietly sat on a chair.

"Still, I should apologize."

"What apology?"

"For disregarding my subordinates."

"Why would I? I've never disregarded dogs."

"You said you couldn't trust them earlier. Isn't that disregarding their martial skills compared to the leader?"

I coldly took a sip of tea.

"Well, it's natural for there to be a difference in level between us and the neighborhood gang. But the Jinryongdae kids, they're all young and talented, right? They showed remarkable feats yesterday, and they even saved an anonymous person. Isn't that the Jinryongdae?"

Sorimsa is a big tree. Although the incident yesterday caused a setback for the Beopwang and many branches fell, the roots remained. Sorim's martial skills and the existence of the surviving anonymous person were proof of that.

Ah, didn't they say that Noseung, a Noryeong, also survived?

"Yes, they fought fiercely against the Amcheon guys as well."

Hyukmu-jin's face filled with pride as he patted his chest.

"That's right. So it's settled. They seem energetic too, and they have deep loyalty to their family. But there's just one problem."

"What is it?"

"You're the unit commander."

"The subordinates work under you, and yet you scold them here?"

"That...?"

"If you're scolding the subordinates, boasting about it and saying you're proud of it?"

"In truth, I treasure them so much..."

Hyukmu-jin regained his composure and poured out his words as if he had been waiting to say them.

"And the mission I have now is to protect the alliance between enemies and the leader."

"But what about before?"

"What mission did you have before?"

"Well, that was obviously guarding Lord Soga."

Clank.

I chuckled and threw it onto the table from my embrace.

A metallic sound accompanied the yellowish shimmering golden mask, and the person who witnessed it gasped.

"Hyuk! W-where did you..."

"Where did I get it? What should I do? You clung to me after the qualifiers were over."

"Just a moment, you misunderstand. I was really busy guarding and hardly blinked..."

"Misunderstand? It's good to misunderstand. Make sure you don't have any chance to blink from now on."

Silence. Utter silence.

Even in such a serious atmosphere, it was audible enough to reach my ears. Hyukmu-jin's pupils shook as if experiencing an earthquake.

"Are you guarding at a gambling den, you bastard? I didn't even need to recognize you. The legend says that you won a hundred thousand nyang in one go and immediately lost another hundred thousand nyang. You're not a legend, you're a legend-class."

Even in such a grave atmosphere, I had said everything.

I even heard a rumor that one of the servants working in the Mu-rim League, Toto or Dodo, left after being slapped by the commissioner due to a big deal.

"If you cherished your subordinates that much, you would've collected membership fees and put money on it. Did you personally take it to avoid lowering the dividend rate?"

Silence. No words.

Even if he had ten mouths, he wouldn't be able to say anything. With a pale face, Hyukmu-jin barely opened his mouth.

"Life is originally... a single room."

This guy still hasn't come to his senses.

At that moment, when I clenched my fist, there was no sign or sound.

As if by magic, the young man who had climbed up several feet and settled on the window sill, or rather an old man, smiled and waved his hand.

"Can we talk for a moment, friend?"

Friend, what a joke.

I sighed inwardly as I looked at Geomseong Ma Jong-hak.
