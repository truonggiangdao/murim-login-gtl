Gawng!

The air in the office felt tense.

Park Ji-hoon's forehead shattered the table and slammed into the floor. Crack! The floor was engraved with spiderweb-like golden marks.

"Ugh."

I pressed my knees against Park Ji-hoon's back, as if to suppress the pain.

My eyes, looking at the back of his head, were filled with astonishment.

"Heh, look at this:
Modern hunters don't have a skill called Mugong.

Even those focused on close combat, like Black Hunter Im Young-jun, rarely prioritize martial arts (0407) and tend to concentrate on weapon skills.

"That's a way to increase survival rate:
But Park Ji-hoon was different. Although it was only a momentary glimpse, the movements he showed were comparable to the pinnacle masters of the martial arts world.

"He was a bit unskilled, but he seemed like a master who had reached a high level."

I thought simplistically and was surprised. Although the outcome was determined quickly, just exchanging blows with him five times went far beyond my expectations.

"Was this level of martial arts still present in modern times? Why hasn't it been revealed yet?"

I asked, expressing my doubts.

"Where did you learn that just now?"
Park Ji-hoon replied in a suppressed voice,
"Before you regret, think quickly."

"I see. So you still have plenty of strength."

Thud! Cool!

Once, twice, thrice.

Every time I grabbed his hair and brought it down, suppressed groans erupted. Blood splattered here and there on the spotless office floor, without a speck of dust.

Park Tae-seop, who had been watching the situation, suddenly spoke up.
"Enough for now."

"Is this guy the guild leader's son?"

"Is he really the son?"

"Or is it a daughter?"

"Of course not."

"Then it's not a problem for the guild leader. If you cross the line here, I don't know what I'll do either."

Park Tae-seop's eyebrows twitched.

"He's my relative."

"You're even more annoying. My old nickname used to be Hwansindong Buldak Bokkeumson... Would you like to taste it?"

"I'm a person with dignity. I have no intention of fighting with a young guy like you. He's an important business partner."

"He's a manager sent by the business partner. No, calling him a business partner is embarrassing considering how easily he's swayed. Seems like he's almost at the level of a pants executive. Did you find any weaknesses?"

As if pricking a painful spot, he furrowed his brows.

"You're quick on the uptake. I've heard that your intelligence isn't good, though."

It's obvious who said such words even without asking.

I grasped Park Ji-hoon's waxed hair more roughly and confidently.

"I'm a slow learner. But once I learn something, I don't forget."

"I learned it properly this time, so let go of me."

"That's what I was planning to do anyway."

As I held Park Ji-hoon's struggling head, Park Tae-seop nodded slightly.

"Good idea..."

With the head raised, I brought it down forcefully.

Crack!

Once more?

Gwajik!

Following the loud noise, the floor shattered.
I inserted the tip of my foot into the back of his neck as he wriggled like a fish, and he slid down to the floor.

"This!"

Park Ji-hoon, who woke up from the shock, trembled and shivered while wiping off the blood.

He spoke towards Park Tae-seop, who couldn't continue his words.

"I messed with your brain. Is that enough?"

"You... are quite something."

"Should I only cut the arms of those who ignore warnings?"

"Even though I don't particularly like that guy, it would have been better for his well-being if he had listened to my advice."

A firm expression and voice. That is sincerity.

Rather than fear, I became curious. Who is this person that even Park Tae-seop, a hero of the great upheaval and the highest-ranked player in the country, is hesitant towards?

With a puzzled expression on my face, I asked.

"Who is it? Earlier, that guy only referred to him as 'that person.'"

"I can't tell you. Even if I were to tell you, you would only resent me later."

"Why make such a fuss? Is that person some sort of Asmodeus?"

"If I were to choose an enemy, I'd prefer a demon lord. That way, the whole world would fight together... But what are you doing now?"

Park Tae-seop widened his eyes and looked at me.

No, more precisely, he looked at the mobile phone in my hand.

"I'm looking at my phone."

"Suddenly?"

"Yes."

What kind of crazy person is this? That's the exact expression.

Park Tae-seop gave me a bewildered look and asked with a skeptical tone.

"What are you doing with that?"

"What else? Since you didn't tell me, I'm trying to find the number myself."

"A number?"

"Yes, that person's number."

"Wait, are you serious?"

"Yes. I took it out of that guy's pocket earlier."

In response to my answer, Park Tae-seop narrowed his eyes, and Park Ji-hoon, who had been spewing blood while enduring pain, shouted without forgetting his agony.

"You can't give it to me right away!"

"Yeah, I can't give it to you."

I fiddled with the unidentified mobile phone in my hand.

Its appearance is different from the one I saw on that guy at the apartment. It must be for secret communications, I suppose.

It's not strange for people involved in secretive activities to carry two or three mobile phones.

"Since he's a person with many secrets."

When I touched the screen, two messages appeared along with a lock icon, instructing to use fingerprint and iris recognition.

Well, fingerprint recognition is understandable, but what's with the iris recognition?

I gestured towards Park Ji-hoon, who was struggling to stand up.

"Hey, come here. Let's do fingerprint and iris recognition."

"Jin Tae-kyung, you crazy bastard. Do you know what you're doing?"

"Yeah, I know. So come over before the eye gouging and finger pulling."

"Don't provoke me. I know without you telling me."

Park Ji-hoon, who had bitten his lip, spoke.

But unlike before when he was struggling to breathe, now he was overflowing with energy. Despite the blood stains here and there, his broken forehead and nose seemed to have healed, and his stamina was fully restored.

Finally, I noticed a small reinforced glass bottle rolling out from his torn pocket.

"A potion?"

"When there's an enemy in front of you, don't let your guard down until the end. Haven't you learned that in training?"

During the moment I glanced at my phone, he took out the hidden item and unscrewed the cap. I shrugged and replied.

"That's when the skills are evenly matched. The current situation isn't like that, right?"

"Height?"

"I don't know where you learned what from whom... ~."

According to the resolution of the "열화신공 (Flaming Divine Art)," the dormant dragon awakened as Jin-gi utilized his power.

I stared at Park Ji-hoon with a fierce gaze.

"You and I, we're on different levels. You little punk."

In an instant, the dragon composed of countless flames scattered and dispersed. It awakened with a surge of blood.

Without hesitation, it charged towards us.

The combined strength of two forces reunited at a single destination.

Scattered, compressed. And released.

Boom!

The already chilly weather turned into scorching summer inside the office. A massive flame burst forth in an instant.

"Did you feel it?"

I exhaled a hot breath.

Amidst the wavering flames, I saw a person filled with astonishment. A rigid face and raging eyes.

"You... Ahh~"

A groaning sound escaped from between Park Ji-hoon's lips.

"How is this possible?"

"I told you. It's different."

Like flipping over a glass of ice water, the guy shivered. He gnashed his lips with such force that his flesh burst, and blood flowed.

"This... This is unbelievable. How could you..."

The distorted face mumbled, then suddenly opened its mouth.

"I need your help."

It was clear who he was referring to.

Guild Leader Park Tae-seop, who had looked at me with eyes filled with surprise, spoke in a heavy voice.

"Is there a way to refuse that proposition?"

"There isn't."

"And if I refuse anyway?"

"Definite rewards and punishments according to your choice. I believe the Guild Leader is well aware of 'his' methods."

"...I'm getting tired of this."

With a sigh, Park Tae-seop took out a 60-centimeter-long stick from his pocket.

As he touched the attached magic stone at its end, a pure white sword materialized.

Tsst! Tsst! Tsst!

"Don't blame me."

With a bitter remark, Park Tae-seop aimed the blue aura of his servant sword towards me.

Facing off against him was a hero of the great upheaval, a top-ranked player in the country. A tremendous force surged from his body as he confronted my power.

With his formidable troops, Park Ji-hoon smiled coldly.

"It's over now."

"Is it over?"

I laughed out loud.

I thought he was somewhat smart when he went to Korea University, but it seems he conveniently forgot what I told him last time.

"After it's over, I'm the one making the decisions, you idiot."

Park Ji-hoon recklessly pulled the trigger, signaling the start on his own. However, he didn't anticipate the most important factor.

There is no finish line in this race.

And I am the one who determines where it ends.

"Inventory open."

Summon White Flame (6).

Whoosh. I covered the ground with flames as I stepped forward.

The blue flames flowing from the edge of the spear burned in all directions, rushing towards the enemy.

With a powerful aura, a massive greatsword soared through the air. The blue aura attached to the sword was more intense and fierce than anything I had ever seen in reality.

Indeed, a top-ranked player.

Strength and mana.

Although they have different names, their essence remains the same. In that sense, the power possessed by Park Tae-seop is inferior to mine.

But...

"That's far enough."

As I thought, I swung my spear upwards.

My hair grazed the ceiling, and the sword that had been sweeping towards my waist sliced through empty air.

Whooong! Crash! Crash! Crash!

Everything was swept away by the immense pressure. The reinforced glass that covered one side of the office shattered and crashed to the ground.

Before the screams from below could reach me, I aimed the edge of the spear at Park Tae-seop's chin.

Sweeek, pah-ang!

With a muffled sound, Park Tae-seop's knees hit the ground. He urgently blocked the attack with a shield in his other hand, and his eyes widened in astonishment.

"What is this!"

By now, he must be feeling the overwhelming pressure pressing down on him. It was the difference in their physical abilities and the gap caused by their different ways of utilizing energy.

"Hunters are indeed inefficient."

On the other hand, the martial arts of the martial world explosively increased the efficiency of their attacks. This was why renowned martial arts such as Gupailbang or Odaese-ga were so powerful.

Various martial arts unfolded from the depths of the heart, showcasing exceptional internal strength.

When those small gears fit together perfectly, it was called Shin Gong (神功), the divine skill.

"Disperse, compress, release."

Internal strength was like a rare resource. It had to be used optimally when necessary... even Park Tae-seop, a top-ranked hunter, couldn't completely surpass its limitations.

Clang! Clang! Bang!

As Park Tae-seop blocked a total of four attacks, his shield was split in half, and a flash shot towards his side.

"I'm dead!"

Without a doubt, the owner of the sharp and slender rapier, 03060, was Park Ji-hoon. In the moment he thought he had avoided it, an aura extended from the tip of the sword and grazed his side.

Slice!

Regret flashed across Park Ji-hoon's face. It was because his aura had only sliced through his clothes.

I checked my untouched side and licked my lips.

"...This is quite interesting."

"Interesting? Isn't it frightening?"

"Did that human, whether it's him or her, inform you about me?"

"Shut up. You're not worthy of mentioning them."

"Well, you're right about that. By any chance, are you from a pseudo-religious sect or something?"

"That bastard...!"

Whoosh! Shh, shh, shh!

Park Tae-seop's greatsword flew from the right, and Park Ji-hoon's rapier came from the left.

While watching the two rushing towards me, I almost raised my arms.

Clang! Clang!

I blocked Park Tae-seop's greatsword with Byakryeon and Park Ji-hoon's rapier with a small dagger, then smoothly twisted my wrist.

Clink!

The four blades that had clashed tightly were now interlocked.

I recalled the martial arts of the Sword Saint Maejonghak.

The flowing motion of his sword.

And I unleashed it.

Swoosh.

The blades of the spear and the dagger slid like snakes. Neither the massive greatsword nor the thin rapier could obstruct their path.

Soon, the sharpened edges of the two blades touched the throats of the two men.

"Discard your weapons."

Sshh, hh!

Two pairs of eyes filled with astonishment were fixed on me.

Park Ji-hoon spoke in a voice filled with anger and despair.

"How...?"

"Didn't you hear what I said?"

Thud!

There was no hesitation. As I lifted my leg, his kneecap shattered, accompanied by a scream.

"Aaah!"

"You have two arms left. It won't match with just one leg."

It was at that moment, as I was about to break the remaining leg.

"That's enough."

A foreign voice pierced through.

The deep and low voice made my spine tingle and my hairs stand on end.

"An extremely skilled master?"
