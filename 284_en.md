"That seems like enough."

It was an unexpected event.

As the voice from behind reached my ears, my mind grew as cold as ice.

"When did it happen?"

I couldn't sense any signs. Even considering that I was in the middle of a battle, it was something that shouldn't have happened.

If they managed to avoid my senses at the peak of my abilities, there's only one answer.

"A master of supreme skill."

I slowly turned around. Amidst the debris of the crumbling wall, there was a person silently gazing in this direction.

"Nice to meet you."

He appeared to be in his early 40s, a middle-aged man. His sharp features, which seemed like they were drawn by a bot, and a strong physique that couldn't be hidden even by his clothes.

"Powerful." As soon as I felt the aura emanating from his body, my heart sank. Simultaneously, my accumulated experience and sharpened senses whispered to me.

The middle-aged man in front of me was undoubtedly a master of supreme skill, something that the current me could never achieve.

"Young friend, you have a keen sense. It's more than I expected."

The middle-aged man, who had been observing me with an intrigued gaze, suddenly tilted his head.

"No, is it because you recognize my face?"

"...Both."

The shock brought about by the appearance of the middle-aged man sparked something inside me. I tried my best to remain composed, but my cracked voice and trembling eyes couldn't be concealed.

"Well, it's not surprising. My face must have been sold one or two times."

The nonchalant middle-aged man raised his head and took a step forward.

He extended his hand towards me, traversing through the chaotic office.

"Nice to meet you. I am Lee Jeong-ryong."

A short and simple self-introduction.

However, the name Lee Jeong-ryong carries significant meaning and influence, far from being ordinary or simple.

He is someone who can use his face and name as identification anywhere in the world.

"The second-in-command of the Ares Guild and one of the two Five-Gold Hunters possessed by the Republic of Korea."

He is Lee Jeong-ryong, wielding the full authority of the Ares Guild in place of the guild master.

The Ares Guild, which holds the world within its grasp. Their influence extends not only to politics and the economy but also to hunters.

It's as if there are two presidential offices in the Republic of Korea.

Why would such a giant figure appear here and now?

"Damn, it's so obvious."

Suddenly, Park Tae-seop's words from our conversation flashed through my mind.

"Who is it? That guy earlier kept saying 'that person'."

"I can't say. Even if I told you, you would only blame me later."

"Why go to such lengths? Is he some kind of Asmodaeus?"

"If we consider him an enemy, I'd prefer him to be a demon lord. The whole world would fight alongside us."

The gears in my mind were already turning.

If the "person" Park Ji-hoon mentioned is Lee Jeong-ryong, and if the mastermind behind this incident is the Ares Guild, then everything falls perfectly into place.

"This... The situation is turning into a mess."

Blood ran cold at the appearance of an unexpected giant.

While I tried to maintain my composure, I couldn't hide the tension in my voice and trembling gaze.

However, Lee Jeong-ryong smiled softly and spoke.

"I've heard your name before. You're even better in person than the rumors."

"...Thank you."

"It's not a welcoming face at all."

"How could it be? You're known as

 a Five-Gold Hunter recognized worldwide."

"It's just a reputation. It's far from being compared to the guild master. But anyway..."

With his characteristic laughter, Lee Jeong-ryong reached out his empty hand.

"When will you shake hands with me? It's starting to get embarrassing."

As I listened to his friendly laughter and the lighthearted words, I couldn't help but think that there's a snake with about a hundred cobras coiled up inside him.

And I am the one who detests snakes.

"Sorry, but I don't have any empty hands right now."

"Is there a problem? It would be easily solved if you let go of what you're holding."

"I can't afford to let go of the problem just for a handshake."

I exerted force on the weapons held in each of my hands.

Ssssh. With a faint sound, thin lines of blood were drawn across Park Tae-seop and Park Ji-hoon's necks.

With Lee Jeong-ryong's arrival, I closed my eyes and sensed a determination from both of them.

"I know that the two of you have a close relationship, so at least exchange greetings."

"A close relationship? Me?"

Lee Jeong-ryong untied his coat.

"We've known each other since the time of the great upheaval. We've seen each other's faces, haven't we?"

Boldly, Park Tae-seop, the guild master of Myeongdong, spoke.

"Long time no see. Assistant Guild Master Lee Jeong-ryong."

"Yes, it's been a while. But what brings you here?"

"There's something unpleasant... I'm sorry for showing you such an unsightly appearance."

"I don't know what misunderstanding there might be, but it can be resolved through conversation. And who is this young friend beside you?"

"He's my guild member. He has been with our guild since completing training."

Park Ji-hoon opened his mouth, his voice trembling.

"It's nice to meet you. My name is Park Ji-hoon, from the Myeongdong Guild, Team 1."

"쓰여아히지" is not a recognizable word or phrase in Korean, so I'm unable to provide a translation or explanation for it. However, I can translate the rest of the passage for you.

Translation:

I'm not surprised by the fact that I look ten years younger than Park Tae-seop at first glance because of the youthful appearance of Lee Jung-ryong, his subordinate.

I was merely surprised by the banality they displayed.

Everyone in this place knows it. That Lee Jung-ryong was the one who gave the first order to Park Ji-hoon.

But the conversation witnessed by the three people had one meaning.

"Lizard's tail.

The lizard, which had already prepared to cut its tail, looked at me with a gentle smile.

"Did you see? That young man is a complete rookie. He only occasionally exchanges greetings with Guild Master Park."

I laughed and asked, "Are those greetings, by any chance, about secretly sending Black Hunters to cut off someone's arm?"

"Black Hunters? Stop it. That's just a delusion. By the way, I'm talking about Guild Master Park..."

He raised his head and continued, "I think I can provide some help regarding that issue."

"Uh... Help, you say?"

"Yes, help. We need to solve the problem, don't we?"

My previous thoughts were only half correct. The lizard still had no intention of cutting its tail. It wanted to resolve the problem.

My and Lee Jung-ryong's gazes met in the air. A drop of cold sweat dripped down my neck.

This was both a suggestion and a warning. Release those people.

However...

"On a personal level, that might be a bit difficult."

Whether to stop here or continue further, it's my decision.

I had already made up my mind.

"Hmm? Haha."

Lee Jung-ryong laughed and looked at me as if it was amusing.

"Young friend, you have quite a spirit. You're also courageous."

"I often hear such words."

"Arrogant, you mean?"

"I hear that more often."

"Young people full of spirit often get misunderstood."

"I think so too."

"Well, that's fortunate then..."

Lee Jung-ryong's pupils sparkled with an unknown light.

"Now, shouldn't you also change?"

"What do you mean?"

"A well-known celebrity like you, who is also turning thirty, should avoid such misunderstandings."

"I appreciate your words, but I haven't thought about it yet."

"Why?"

"Because the people who say such things to me are usually idiots who are just a year older. It's like a few stray dogs blocking the road. There's no need to run away."

"It won't be good if you get bitten by a fierce dog."

"No matter how fierce a dog may be, it's still just a dog. It's an exaggerated saying, but I believe I can handle it to some extent."

"Indeed... What if it's not a dog blocking the road, but a tiger?"

Lee Jung-ryong's mouth curled up gently.

He is the tiger himself.

A tiger that blocked the path. A predator with fangs and claws that can take lives.

"I should run away then. My small blade cannot defeat a tiger."

"Yes."

"But well, with a few additional settings, we might be able to fight back, right?"

"Settings?"

"Yes. Let's say... that tiger has seriously injured my friend. Something like that as a setting."

He stared at me with a strange gaze.

"Looks like your friend suffered a serious injury."

"Both legs were severed, so it's a difficult situation. I also have young children."

"Quite a detailed setting."

"I came up with it

 while thinking about a plausible setting. Don't worry about simple settings."

"I see..."

Lee Jung-ryong shrugged his shoulders.

"By the way..."

"Standing up against a tiger for a friend... Loyalty, isn't it?"

"I've seen documentaries about loyalty. Dogs, loyalty is no joke."

"But it's reckless."

"Why do you say that?"

"Because you'll be defeated if you fight a tiger."

I smirked and retorted, "You never know. A young and powerful fighter might defeat the tiger."

"... A tiger losing to a deer? It doesn't sound like a well-made documentary."

"I found it entertaining. When the fighter wins, all the beasts in the mountain gather to feast on the tiger's carcass. That scene was particularly memorable."

For the first time, the smile disappeared from Lee Jung-ryong's face.

He must have understood the hidden meaning behind my words. It was a natural reaction.

Seeing his stern expression, it felt like the milk that hadn't existed since infancy was flowing down.

"It's annoying. More than I expected."

After a brief silence, a word popped out.

With his hand still extended, Lee Jung-ryong slowly withdrew it and spoke.

"What do you want?"

I answered without hesitation.

"An apology and compensation. And one person's life."

"A life?"

"Yes. I want one person's life."

Tremors were transmitted from the short sword pressed against Park Ji-hoon's neck. The person who had not uttered a word since Lee Jung-ryong's appearance was trembling with fear of death.

"That's not possible. I can't allow it."

"It's not about permission. It's a demand."

"Distinguish between courage and recklessness. I have patience, but at the same time, I am capricious."

"I am someone lacking basic manners, so at least I should receive what I've given to satisfy my conscience."

"Your demands are excessive. Compensation should already be overflowing."

"Who settles for just the principal? You have to receive it with interest and compound interest."

"What if I refuse?"

"Do you remember the documentary I mentioned earlier?"

"I remember."

"Don't you think it's like trying to put a tiger's teeth back into its skin?"

Lee Jung-ryong's gaze, as he looked at me, sank into darkness.

In an eerily quiet moment, his mouth slowly opened.

"You don't know fear of a tiger."

Whoosh!

Before he finished speaking, his palm, marked by a red aura, flew toward my chest.

Just five steps away. My judgment was made in an instant.

"Byakryeon. Release equipped."

As Byakryeon was stored in the inventory, my freed right hand swung forward.

Disperse, compress, release. The Azure Dragon, who had been eagerly waiting to awaken, burst into blue flames and settled on my palm.

Full power of Flame Enhancement (106%). And collision.

Crack!

The whole building shook as if there was an earthquake, accompanied by a deafening roar.

I received the greatest impact from the aftermath.

Stepping back three steps as if dancing, I vomited a mouthful of bloody saliva from deep within my chest.

"Cough!"

Through the hazy dust falling from the ceiling, Lee Jung-ryong, standing tall in his place, came into view.

"You...?"

Surprised eyes. But the surprise on his side was also only temporary.

In an instant, I felt a power that I could never experience in modern times.

"This is a monster. How can such a thing...?"

I didn't know I could experience something like this in modern times.

In one hand, I held Park Ji-hoon, and in the other, a short sword. While swallowing the blood, I smiled.

"I accept what I asked for."

At the same time, I drove the dagger into Park Ji-hoon's chest.

Thud, thud, thud!

With blood, screams erupted from the boy's mouth.

"Kyaah! Master!"

I wondered how this guy found out, and now I see that they were master and disciple.

"Stop!"

Even shouting like that, Lee Jung-ryong couldn't easily take a step forward.

Every time he tried, I would firmly press the dagger against Park Ji-hoon's neck.

"Oh, if you want to save your cute disciple, you should stay still."

Thud, poof!

Without hesitation, I slashed downward with the dagger. I gouged out everything except the heart, shredded the upper body, and sliced through the thigh muscles.

Slice!

Cutting the calf, I severed the Achilles tendon and, bending down, sliced diagonally across the nape of the neck.

Slice, chop!

"Scream less. There's still one more left."

Poof, poof!

I mercilessly whipped.
