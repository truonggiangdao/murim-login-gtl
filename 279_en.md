[진태경][Jin Tae-kyung]

A name with three characters appeared vividly on the screen.

Park Jihoon, who was unconsciously about to press the call icon, was stopped by a sudden outburst.

"I haven't finished talking. Put that damn phone away and sit down immediately!"

"Are you deaf?"

"No, sir. Of course not."

Park Jihoon turned off the phone screen and slumped down in his chair. Park Tae-seop glared at him with a fiery gaze.

"It seems killing a team leader-level hunter without any hesitation wasn't enough, was it?"

"That part has already been discussed. 'That person' also personally contacted the guild leader and sought their understanding."

"Understanding? Not a threat?"

"If 'that person' hears it, they would feel regretful."

"Why on earth does Jin Tae-kyung have a grudge against the Peace Guild to the extent of becoming a Black Hunter...?"

"Let's leave it at that."

Park Jihoon interrupted with a stern voice.

"There's no need for you to know even the facts you shouldn't know."

Indeed,
"Isn't it important that the guild leader accepted that proposal? Whether it's a leaf or a matchstick. The result is more important than the process."

"Fine. So, is this how you made that important result?"

Park Jihoon furrowed his brows. Park Tae-seop has expressed his dissatisfaction before, but this is the first time it's been so explicit.

What on earth has happened?

"Let's stop arguing about it. What's the problem?"

With a flushed face and rough breaths, Park Tae-seop threw out a single line.

"Two hours ago, there was an emergency contact from Team 11."

Externally, Myeongdong Guild consists of 10 teams.

However, this is merely an external appearance. The 11th team that Park Tae-seop mentioned doesn't officially exist—it's a team composed of Black Hunters.

"You said there was an emergency contact just now?"

"If you have eyes, go and check it yourself."

Park Tae-seop took something out of his coat pocket and tossed it. When Park Jihoon caught it, it turned out to be an old, outdated phone, as if it had been made a long time ago.

The call logs were cleanly erased, and there was only one message that arrived two hours ago, sitting alone in the message inbox.

[Intruder detected.]

A brief one-liner, but the content was alarming.

After closing the phone folder, Park Jihoon asked.

"What was the location?"

"It's quite far away. It's a remote mountain in the middle of nowhere. It's an unsafe zone, and there are no gates around, so there wouldn't be anyone coming by."

"What about the updates since then?"

"If there were any, do you think I would have brought up this conversation?"

"You mean there's been no communication."

"I sent someone to confirm, but... I have a bad feeling about it."

Park Jihoon agreed with his words.

7 years ago, the incident that occurred when I was dispatched to the Myeongdong Guild was directly related to Team 11.

Park Tae-seop, the guildmaster of Myeongdong Guild, expressed strong resistance to hiding and training criminals, but he couldn't defy 'that person's orders.

In that way, they gathered about 30 Black Hunters.

Three A-rank hunters, and twenty-five B-rank hunters.

They have formidable power comparable to or greater than Team 1, which can be considered the elite of the Myeongdong Guild.

But to have communication cut off after the intruder incident...

At that moment when anxiety slowly crawled up in a corner of my heart.

Ring, ring.

The phone I had put in my coat pocket vibrated again. As the vibrations continued, Park Jihoon's anxiety grew larger.

*Beep, beep.* The signal that continued through the receiver abruptly ended with a voicemail.

It was already the tenth call. I had already sent a text message a while ago, but there was no reply.

"It's time to go to work."

The entrance of the high-rise building standing tall in the heart of Seoul was bustling with people.
That's when it happened while I silently observed that sight.

-"Excuse me."

The one who spoke was a man dressed in a suit.

His face was angular, and his gaze was sharp. A strong presence could be felt from his solid build. The colleague standing next to him was similar.

I bravely put away my phone and replied, "Yes, may I help you?"

The well-dressed man opened his mouth.
His name, along with the affiliation of Myeongdong Guild, was clearly written on the name tag on his chest.

"I'm from the security team. We received a report about you, sir."

"Not 'sir.' What kind of report?"

"When we reviewed the footage from 0017/, it seemed like you were loitering in front of our building for quite a while... Do you have any business here?"

Their gazes at me were filled with caution and suspicion.

Wearing comfortable training pants, a hoodie, and a cap pulled down low, plus sunglasses, it's understandable that a report would be filed when someone like me sneaks around the building.

"Sir, would you mind moving to a different location for a moment?"

"No, that's not necessary. And I'm not a 'sir.'"

"It'll only take a moment."

Despite the relatively polite tone, their actions were the opposite.
*Shhh!* With a brief sound of the wind, both of them almost drew their arms simultaneously.

And in the next moment, a question mark appeared on their faces, which were filled with certainty.

Thunk, thud.

They fell.

Silva.
I casually pushed their hands away from my wrists and opened my mouth with a serious expression.

"Hey, hey you disrespectful guys. How dare you touch the teacher?"

"Wait a moment."

"Who are you? What is this?"

The two security team hunters seemed taken aback. They tried to use their strength, but I didn't budge. I just kept my mouth shut.

'I could break their bones, but it's not the right time yet. I'll control myself before causing a big commotion.'

The two cautious hunters cautiously asked, their hands still lingering near their wrists.

"Are you... a hunter?"

"Sorry, but may I know your affiliation and name?"

"I'm Jin Tae-gyeong from the Peace Guild."

"By any chance, the one I know, Sibeoljwa?"

"Seems like you've seen the internet broadcast."

I sighed and lowered my sunglasses. The two surprised hunters quickly lowered their heads.

"It's an honor to meet you."

"The real you looks even more handsome."

Their eyes sparkled like those of a high school student who just saw their favorite idol. Judging from their attitude, they seemed unaware of the deeper secrets.

Well, anything related to Black Hunters must be top secret. If a regular security team hunter knows about it, it must have leaked a long time ago.

"By the way, what brings you to our guild?"

"We came to meet someone we know."

"Someone you know?"

I reached into my wallet and pulled out a piece of paper. It was Park Ji-hoon's business card that I had received and kept before.

"Team 1's Hunter, Park Ji-hoon?"

The security team hunter, who was scratching his head while looking at the business card, asked his colleague.

"Senior, do you know who this person is?"

"Who?"

"Park Ji-hoon from Team 1, a hunter. We know all the hunters in Team 1, but I can't remember this person..."

"Park Ji-hoon, Park Ji-hoon... Ah, that person. Why? You know him too."

As I elbowed his side, he finally realized and exclaimed, "Ah, I see!"

The two of them looked at each other with curious eyes, taking turns looking at the business card.

"What's with this reaction?"

My eyes involuntarily narrowed. The security team hunters, unable to see my hidden reaction behind the sunglasses, asked me.

"Are you quite close to Hunter Park Ji-hoon?"

"We were classmates in middle school."

"Oh, I see. Friends, then."

I smiled softly and replied.

"Well, for now, that's how it is."

"Uh..."

"Just kidding."

It could be a joke, after all.

The security team hunters burst into laughter without realizing what I was thinking and continued with their questions.

"So, did you come to see Hunter Park Ji-hoon?"

"Yes, he wasn't answering the phone. He's not at home either. We thought we might be able to see him if we came to his workplace."

"Oh, I'm sorry about that. We didn't know either..."

"Don't worry too much since you're on a mission. But more importantly, is Ji-hoon inside?"

The senior security team hunter answered.

"He probably won't come out today."

"Not today?"

"Yes, he doesn't come to work often. If we count the frequency, it's about once a month. Even though I've been here for almost a year, I've hardly seen him for a few times, and this guy has just been here for a month..."

"It seems like the hunters from the Myeongdong Guild don't come to work often."

"I can't imagine that. I don't know why, but everyone seems to be okay with it."

Yeah, why is that?

The doubt that settled in my mind was growing stronger.

I spoke without showing any signs.

"Could you do me a favor and contact Ji-hoon? I know there's a separate mobile phone for guild calls."

"Well, that..."

I threw them an offer they couldn't refuse.

"I came here to discuss a cooperative raid. If I ask, I can probably add one or two more people."

"Are you serious?"

Of course, I wasn't.

It was all lies from beginning to end. But I shook off any hesitation and spoke.

"Are you both (rank) hunters?"

"Yes, um..."

"How did you know?"

"Just by looking, it's obvious. But it seems like a waste of skills for you to be in the security team."

Strictly speaking, the guild's security team was no different from being marginalized.

If they were truly skilled hunters, why would they waste themselves in security positions? It would be a profitable business for the guild to deploy them in raids.

The two hunters from the security team couldn't possibly be unaware of that. Radiance filled their eyes as they looked at me.

"We'll contact him right away!"

"Thank you then."

"If there's anything else you need..."

"Could we take a quick tour of the guild? Ji-hoon will be waiting inside."

"Yes, yes, of course."

While the senior hunter hesitated, the junior hunter had a stiff expression.

Just one month since joining. He must be burning with a sense of mission and passion.

"Hey, senior. I don't think that's right."

"What? This kid?"

"I really respect Hunter Jin Tae-gyeong, but isn't this against the guild's regulations?"

"Hey, watch your mouth!"

He shouted, but then realized his mistake and whispered, making sure I could hear.

"Are you crazy? It's a (rank) gate, you know? Even if you rot in the security team for three years, you won't get an opportunity like this."

"Then it's better to report to the team leader first..."

"Ah, this guy is so obstructive. Why do we need a report when we're just taking a quick tour? And it's not just anyone, it's Hunter Jin Tae-gyeong."

"Well, no matter what..."

"Let's have some courtesy, shall we? Hm?"

"Yes? Courtesy?"

In that moment, the junior hunter frowned and spoke, "Using such reckless words in times like these is inappropriate. It's uncomfortable."

"This guy is crazy. Do you want your guild life to become uncomfortable from now on?"

What a mess.

I sighed and stepped forward.

The junior hunter flinched and instinctively clutched his chest.

"Do you have something to say?"

"No. I was just listening, and I was deeply impressed."

"Pardon?"

"You have a strong sense of patriotism. Not to mention your passion. I wanted to convey that to the guild leader when I meet him later."

"The... guild leader?"

"Yes. Ji-hoon mentioned that he would also inform the guild leader. I should mention that there's a talented individual."

Looking at the name tag of the junior hunter, I added, "Hunter Kim Chul-su."

Damn it.

Kim Chul-su's eyes, brimming with passion, trembled with emotion.

With a warm smile, I asked, "Can we go in now?"

Kim Chul-su exclaimed energetically, "Atashaimase!" 

"...Ah, yes. Arigato."

The luxurious 20-story building belonged to the Myeongdong Guild.

After leaving the junior hunter behind, the senior hunter who followed me blabbered on.

"The first to ninth floors are private departments such as taxation, accounting, and corporation, and from the tenth to the nineteenth floors, each floor is occupied by raid teams."

"And the twentieth floor?"

"Of course, it's where the guild leader and the executives are."

"I see."

"The first team is the guild's elite team, so they're on the nineteenth floor."

Ping.

As soon as he finished speaking, the elevator arrived. At that moment, while waiting for the doors to close after pressing the nineteenth floor, it happened.

"Hey, wait!"

With a shout, the senior hunter urgently pressed the open button.

A middle-aged man with a sweaty forehead entered the elevator.

As he glanced at us, he slightly covered his earpiece and replied, "Yes, yes. No, it's not. It's because of the elevator. Yes."

There was a strong aura emanating from him as he continued an important conversation.

"An urgent hunter?"

As the middle-aged man appeared, I gestured with my eyes towards the stiff senior hunter, conveying the question of who he was. He subtly raised a finger and gave a slight nod.

"He's the team leader."

Ah, I see. It was only natural for him to go to the 19th floor as the team leader. I listened attentively to his phone conversation.

And in the next moment, a deep voice pierced through the air.

"Twenty-eight members wiped out? Is that true? Hurry and..."

Oh my, my body trembled as if I had been electrocuted. It was a familiar voice, and on top of that, the number twenty-eight.

"It's you."

The thought flashed through my mind, and my hand moved instinctively.

Click!

"Quick, who are you...!"

I tightly grabbed the team leader's neck like a shackle, and whispered into the receiver.

"Park Jihoon. This damn bastard."
