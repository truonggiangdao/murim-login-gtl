Worry!
The fuselage of the iron golem, which is hard and impeccable, is cut off like
a soft tofu. Even a steel with magical power cannot prevent the fiery keeper.
Wherever the spear blade was cut and pierced, a path of fire was made, and
the metal dripping.
Tiring. Tiring.
-You have defeated [Lv.95 Iron Golem]!
-You have gained a considerable amount of experience!
-You have defeated [Lv.95 Iron Golem]!
-A considerable amount of experience... … .
“What, why are you so weak?”
It's just like I'm going to be surprised.
The Iron Golem is a very, very difficult monster. If you don't destroy the
nucleus, you will never die, and your destructive power and durability are
tremendously high.
'The resilience beyond trolls, the destructive power of ogres.'
In addition, it has a tireless stamina and magic resistance.
It is a fault that the speed is a little slow, but if you look at the numerous
advantages one by one, I think this is a fault.
I am not treated as a top class among golems, which are A-class monsters.
By the way… … .
'Why is this so easy?'
The wind blows my hair. The fist of an iron golem that hits the crown.
A scream broke out among the new guild members.
"Dangerous!"

She needs some education. If you think your teammates are in danger, you
need to pick up the nearby balls and hold them in check. What is that
doing.
'Because I'm new.'
I kicked my tongue and closed my fists.
At the moment of splitting a second in half and splitting it, decades of
aerodynamics run down the arm.
The fiery keeper reconciled with a blue flame and stood in his fist.
And… … .
Zeong
I stretched out as it is. It was a clash between fists and fists, iron fists, and
annihilating priesthoods (滅炎神拳).
With a metallic sound, the ground sank and compressed air exploded. I saw
an iron golem retreating through the rushing wind.
One arm, which had flashed firmly a few seconds ago, turned into molten
iron and was falling like a fire dragon swallowed it-Bake?
The Iron Golem is a magical doll with no emotions.
But now, I seemed to have read the feeling of embarrassment from him.
“Oh, of course I have to bake it.”
The ground spurs and soars.
The iron golem's torso, shiny with iron, catches my eyes. And it was felt.
The core of a golem that pulsates deep in the chest and emits magic power
in the giant fuselage of a guy that doesn't exist as a ki (氣).
“This hunter cooks for free.”
He slammed his front chest with his open palm. The cool metal was eaten by
the heat of the flame god Jang (⽕焰神掌).
Chii-ik, metal splashed and a big hole was created in his chest. The nucleus
that supplied the magic power broke out without force.

-Ooh ooh...
Kugugugung!
A huge fuselage that has lost its core loses its strength and falls to pieces.
Just as a person with a burst of heart cannot breathe, so is the iron golem.
I settled lightly on the metal piled up like a small garden.
“Now, next.”
-Bake it!
With a mechanical roar, sparkling waves of steel came from everywhere.
'If you catch all of this, will you level up once?'
I swung the spear with anticipation. The Hwaryongshinchang, who has
risen to the height of the seven castles, burns air and sound to create a path
of fire.
Qawah!
Kugugung!
With a loud roar, the last iron golem was demolished.
It took only a few minutes to deal with a dozen A-class monsters.
As I looked around, everyone was looking at me with amazement.
“Such crazy… …
"saw? Did you just see it?”
"Yes. saw.''
“Wow, I played with A-class monsters. I can't even see it.”
“I saw it.”
Voices were heard above the heads of the roaring new guild members.
“Is the raid already over? After battle, take care of the wreckage and watch
out for your surroundings. I hope that the guild leader and Mr. Songi will take control.”

Words are words of honor, but their tone is like a whip.
The new recruits who fluttered their shoulders at the appearance of Team
Leader Choi, who had fallen lightly, scattered in search of work to do.
'Sometimes a person is charismatic.'
Should it be called a unique aura. All of those things are born.
When I was thinking about that, Team Leader Choi, who had come to my
eyes, opened his mouth with a firm face.
“Jin Tae-kyung. I thought about it before, but now I can't stand it.”
"Yes."
“Where did you buy that window?”
Yes, I was originally a human like this. I forgot for a moment.
Whether you know my thoughts or not, Team Leader Choi's gaze was fixed
on the spear, white flame in my hand.
“It’s like seeing a piece of art. Classical yet beautiful Chinese design, is it
made of spirit stone?”
No, it's made of late-year-old iron.
Of course, if I told the truth, it was a headache, so I looked around.
“Well, because I don’t know.”
Team leader Choi glanced up and down the window with a greedy gaze.
“It’s a surprise, but if you’re going to sell it to me… … "
"There is not. I don't sell.”
I can't sell it even if I want to sell it. It's an item that can only be used by me.
The item information also says so.
Perhaps that is why it is the only item that travels between two worlds in the
inventory divided into Moorim and Hyundai.
"Alas......"
As if unfortunately, team leader Choi, who had re-appeted, turned the topic.

“By the way, I was really surprised. You are getting stronger and stronger.”
I replied with half joke and half serious.
“It’s enough to learn to die for a year from an ultra-climate expert with
dementia.”
“Dementia, what?”
“The ultra high demand.”
Isn't that a word in a martial arts novel? The climax stick, the super stick
stick.”
"Yes. When I retire later, I want to write a post as a hobby. Login Moorim.
With that title.”
“The title is not so good. I can't hit the jackpot.”
“In fact, I have no intention of writing it.”
Team leader Choi opened his mouth, smiling.
“It's new to say every time, but every time I see Mr. Jin Tae-kyung, I
sometimes think that way.”
"which?"
“I think this person is the same person as me.”
His pale brown eyes seemed to glow reddishly.
“The 10,000-year F-Class Hunter has become so strong in just a few
months? If I hadn't seen Jin Tae-kyung in person, I wouldn't have believed
it.”
It is a reasonable doubt.
Secondary awakenings are not common, but they are not so few to say that
they are very sparse.
However, in my case, I achieved a level that far exceeded the general
secondary awakening.
Moreover, Team Leader Choi is the person who watched me closely.
'Even though other people don't know, Team Leader Choi is not fooled.'

In his eyes, I am the second, third, and fourth awakening.
I licked my dry lips.
This is a secret that only I must keep until I die.
If it leaks out, he might be taken to the NIS, or NASA, and lived as a subject
for life.
"manager. I'm sorry, but that... … .”
Team leader Choi, who shook his head small, cut my words.
“I know, that there is a secret that even Jin Tae-kyung cannot tell. In a way,
I have no intention of blaming it because it is in a similar position.”
Similar position?
His words continued before the question was even settled in his head.
“The unprecedented second awakening hunter ever. That would be enough.
Deacon Kim has the same idea.”
Song Song or Lim Kkeok-jung joined later, but Deacon Kim is the person
who watched my growth next to Team Leader Choi.
Still, F-Class Hunter's rebellion, a miracle. Well, if the two people shut their
mouths in the field of Internet news articles with such a title, we can finish
it at this point.
I looked down.
"Thank you. I owe you.”
"It was nothing."
“But can I ask just one thing?”
“Anything.”
“What's the reason for doing this?”
"Oh, that's it."
Team leader Choi laughed with a sound of cheating.
“You just said it with your own mouth. I am in debt.”

“I did.”
“I’m thinking of paying the debt and interest to get it.”
"......?"
“Only know that way. then."
After finishing the talk, Team Leader Choi stopped trying to turn around.
“Show me the novel you mentioned earlier, if you write it later, I like
reading novels more than I see them.”
“Then you won't be able to read mine.”
“Why?”
If you write, it's not your favorite novel, it's an essay that translates my
experience.
Team leader Choi tilted his head at my silent smile.
The workshop, which was scheduled for 7 days and 6 nights, ended in only
three days.
It was because there were no more monsters to catch when I wandered
around alone and slapped those who stood out.
“Originally, it was the purpose of unity through raids, but this is how it
works.”
Song Song-i's eyes looked at me as if he was absurd.
It was not enough to wipe out the golems in the gate, so I killed the boss
monster alone.
The experience was very sweet.
Hmm.”
“New recruits should also gain experience in raids. If you look at the
monsters, why are you so anxious because you can't come out?
“Good is good. Go ahead.”
“Hey, Tae-kyung Jin.”

“Oh huh, let’s move on. Song Songi.”
“What if you just can’t go over it?”
“I will confess and punish you.”
Song Song-i, with her mouth shut, stepped back with a terrified face.
I have achieved my purpose, but why do I feel like tears will fall?
'Ha, I loved you... … '
Like the male protagonist of tragedy, he tramped.
As they exited the dungeon, reporters camping outside the gate fired
camera flashes at once.
I spent a year in Moorim, but only a few days have passed in Hyundai.
It will take more time for your interest and passion for me to cool down.
"Wait. Please step back, reporters!”
“From here on, only the person concerned can enter!”
It was only after the guards stuck and blocked the reporters from the flash
baptism.
After the shutter sound stopped, the new guild members, whose faces were
burning with excitement, shouted loudly.
“You have a hard time!”
Everyone's eyes are shining brightly. The eyes that look at us are filled with
envy and respect.
Of course, I am the most focused.
As I was uncomfortable for nothing, I turned my head to the first-year
members, and suddenly realized that one person was missing.
“How about Kwakjeong?”
"uh? Then, it doesn't exist.”
Team leader Choi replied.

“On the way, he only talked to me and slipped away. I heard that something
happened.”
“What happened to him, so he didn’t change his equipment and went right
away?”
“Isn’t it that urgent?”
What? Are there any problems in the house?
One corner of my heart is steamed for nothing.
'As I thought about it, I didn't have a long conversation when I came back.'
He moved most of the raid alone, so he couldn't have much conversation
with other people.
Looking back now, it seems that Lim's expression was a little dark.
I thought it was just because I was nervous... … .
'Is there a real big problem?'
Even after changing equipment and disbanding, the thought did not leave
my mind.
After thinking about making a phone call, I finally sent a tok to the stored
contact. It's a simple message to drink a drink sooner or later.
Because you will have your own worries, it could be a useless and useless
example.
'This should be enough.'
It was when I was staring at the number 1 that never disappears.
Wow.
The smartphone trembled.
On the screen, the name saved along with the phone icon appeared.
The name I saved a few months ago and forgot.
[Garaam Middle School Alumni Park Ji-hoon]
The day I went to buy a house, I met him by chance, and he never contacted him.
What's wrong with this guy?
I answered the phone with a light question.
