"Dare to touch my disciple!"

"I only did as much as I received. With this, I have recovered the principal, so let's discuss the remaining compound interest with our guild leadership."

"Understood, I accept."

"Today's events... I will never forget."

Just a few minutes ago, we had this conversation.

Jeong Ryong left his mark, leaving his life hanging by a thread.

Although I administered emergency treatment with the potions I had, Park Ji Hoon's injuries were too deep to be healed by potions alone. Seeing my disciple in such a state must have made my heart race.

"Hmm."

As Jeong Ryong's presence, felt from afar, completely disappeared, a sigh of relief escaped me involuntarily.

"Phew, it was tough."

As the tension that had been holding on until the very end loosened.

I'm exhausted. Although I sustained some injuries from the clash with Jeong Ryong, the mental fatigue outweighed them.

"I've caused quite an accident."

Today, I turned the tables on the internationally recognized Grade 8 Hunter and the massive guild that he represented.

A thrilling tightrope walk on a dim cliff.

Me and Jeong Ryong met in the middle of that tightrope, and in the end, it was him who retreated.

"It couldn't be helped. I delved into that aspect accurately."

People who have a lot to lose tend to fear danger.

Jeong Ryong knows that I am not an easy opponent.

With just one clash, he confirmed that I had the upper hand, but it should have been enough for him to realize that the looming figure before him was a formidable adversary.

As I wiped the blood off my lips, I pondered.

"Three steps. Today, I took three steps back against Jeong Ryong."

But those three steps will soon become two steps, and before long, two steps will narrow down to one step.

And after that...

"I will surpass you."

As I said to Jeong Ryong, I have never seen a documentary where someone overcame a great tiger like him one-on-one.

But I have the potential to continuously grow, just like the code name Jamyeong0800.

"When that time comes, both I and our guild will be stronger than you ever imagined."

What I achieved with this incident is not just revenge out of impulse. It is an excellent opportunity to grow the Peace Guild.

If we had backed down after being attacked by the Black Hunter, we would have remained a mediocre guild. But by standing up, we gained revenge and rewards, and what happens next depends on the capabilities of Team Leader Choi.

"He will handle it well, I believe."

Suddenly, the conversation I had with Team Leader Choi a few hours ago came to mind.

"What are you planning to do?"

"Well, if my guess is correct, I can't imagine what crazy things he will do."

"Are you planning to raid the Myeongdong Guild or something?"

"No, I can't guarantee that. Song Song said he went insane, and Kim Jipsa just stared without saying a word."

But Team Leader Choi was different.

What he said exceeded my expectations.

"Then go."

"What?"

"The Myeongdong Guild. Go there and crush them and make a mess of things. Oh, but I don't mean destroying buildings and killing people on the streets. Because if you do, the prison will become the guild's headquarters. Just make it clear that they have been dealt with."

"I thought you would stop me."

"I would have stopped you if it wasn't Jin Taekyung. Somehow, he managed to grasp the situation and sought other ways."

"But why?"

"Jin Taekyung is someone who, at first glance, may

 seem reckless, but he always moves with the worst-case scenario in mind. And he always brings back the best possible outcome."

"Are you really okay with this?"

"I intend to make the Peace Guild the best in the world. If we retreat when our guild members are attacked, we can never become the best."

"Then, I will do it."

"Please do. Whatever the outcome, I take responsibility."

Team Leader Choi's final words resonated vividly in the air.

"I trust Mr. Jintae-kyung, perhaps even more than myself."

I responded to the infinite trust he had shown me.

I returned to Park Ji-hoon more than what was done to Im Chik-jeong, and I implicitly received apologies and compensation from formidable enemies that were beyond reach.

"The world's greatest guild..."

As I recalled Team Leader Choi's bold aspirations, a smirk escaped me.

I took out my phone and made a call. The person on the other end picked up just before the signal could fade away.

"Yes, this is Choi Min-woo."

Team Leader Choi. It was him indeed.

"You have a lot to explain. Where should we meet?"

"Mr. Jintae-kyung! You're alive!"

The young disciple's mentor cried out urgently, his footsteps quickening.

Park Tae-seom, the guild master of Myeongdong, who had been closely following behind Lee Jeong-ryong, watched his back with astonished eyes.

"Did Lee Jeong-ryong have these hidden talents?"

He had observed Lee Jeong-ryong for many years, thinking that he was someone difficult to approach during the upheaval.

However, after the establishment of the Ares Guild and Lee Jeong-ryong taking control, Park Tae-seom could clearly see his true nature.

Strong as steel, secretive as a snake, and capable of executing tasks that would make others shudder.

From Park Tae-seom's perspective, Lee Jeong-ryong was such a person, someone he didn't want to encounter as an enemy or an ally.

"So, he was ultimately just a human."

But Park Tae-seom felt a strange sense of inspiration. As soon as he stepped out of the long corridor and entered alone, he disappeared without a trace.

"Have you arrived?"

A middle-aged man stood there. He carried himself with the discipline of a soldier, and his well-trained physique was evident even in the black suit he wore.

Behind him stood two individuals, a man and a woman, like iron towers. On their chests were emblems representing the Ares Guild.

"I couldn't even sense a miracle..."

Park Tae-seom's shock was not the only thing.

Beyond the middle-aged man's shoulder, the sight of over a hundred fallen Myeongdong guild members caught his attention.

"What is this...!"

The middle-aged man responded in a dry voice.

"They were put to sleep with sleep magic. For now, that is."

For now.

Those were profound words. At present, they were merely asleep with the power of magic, but it also meant they could sleep forever.

In that fleeting moment, as Park Tae-seom was about to shout in outrage...

"Is there a problem?"

Lee Jeong-ryong slowly turned around to face him. And upon seeing his face, Park Tae-seom realized he had been greatly mistaken.

"It was all an act... I was mistaken."

There was no trace of any emotion in Lee Jeong-ryong's expressionless face and deeply sunken eyes.

Gone were the urgent footsteps and the mentor's heartfelt shouts of concern for his young disciple.

A chilling aura crawled up Park Tae-seom's spine.

"Listen, Guild Master Park."

Hidden beneath the soft voice was a sense of a sharp blade. It felt as if the tongue of a venomous snake moved, dripping with poison.

"About 20 years ago, one day, you came to me and knelt in despair."

"Yes, I still remember."

Park Tae-seom clenched his teeth.

How can one not remember? It's already been 20 years, but the sense of urgency I felt at that time still remained deep inside me.

Consecutive large-scale business failures, enormous debts, and the gaze of those who looked at me as a failure...
It was a living hell worse than a major upheaval for Park Tae-seop.

The person who came after numerous rejections from those around him was none other than Lee Jeong-ryong.
He silently looked at Park Tae-seop, who was on his knees, and asked one question.

"If I help you, what can you do for me?"
Park Tae-seop didn't hesitate in his answer.

"I'll do anything."

"That's pleasing to hear."

If he hadn't said those words, what would have happened?

Over the past 20 years, I've asked myself that question hundreds, if not thousands, of times, but it's meaningless. We've come too far to turn back.
There was no such thing as a free favor, and I had to engage in all sorts of illegal activities for Lee Jeong-ryong.

Suddenly, when I regained my senses, all I could see was myself being dragged while holding onto a leash.

"Whenever I see Park Guild Leader these days, I feel a sense of resentment. The words you said to me back then feel like empty promises."

"Is that so?"

"No, it's just how people are. Even if they receive a favor, they quickly forget to be grateful and only complain. When you save a person on the brink of death, their thoughts change. That's the truth. Haha."
Contrary to the rising corners of his mouth, Lee Jeong-ryong's gaze was as cold as ice.

When Park Tae-seop lowered his head with a firm expression, a softened voice followed.

"This is just a way of saying let's continue doing well in the future. Don't worry, your guild members will be safe. Isn't that right, Team Leader Seok?"

The middle-aged man who was in charge of Lee Jeong-ryong's security, Team Leader Seok, replied in a dry voice.

"Of course."

"Well then, I guess I should be going now. See you next time."

*Click*

Park Tae-seop watched as Lee Jeong-ryong, who tapped his rigid shoulders, left with a firm expression.

Inside the descending elevator, Team Leader Seok spoke up.
"Should I take care of it?"

"Who? Ah, Park Tae-seop."

"Yes. He seemed uneasy."

"That guy wears his thoughts on his face. In the first few years, he was very respectful, but once he got comfortable and satisfied, he started having other thoughts."

"I know too much. This time, the situation was handled carelessly, and it backfired on the guild leader."

For the first time, anger crept into Team Leader Seok's voice. He was truly angry.

Lee Jeong-ryong, who confirmed his unwavering loyalty, smiled sadly.

"First, let's calm down. And I saw what you did earlier, it was quite amusing."

"What do you mean?"

"It's natural for a leader to delegate work to unreliable people. If I had decided, would I have entrusted the job to these half-wits?"
Team Leader Seok let out a heartfelt sigh.
"Everyone expected it."

"I've only just dipped my toe in. If I see that it's not enough, I'll sprinkle some salt and add some pepper."

"As expected of the guild leader."

Lee Jeong-ryong smiled softly at Team Leader Seok's admiring gaze.

But his inner thoughts were different. He had a thought that he couldn't reveal.
