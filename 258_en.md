"I feel dizzy. Where are you going, you bastard!"

In the past, I might have wondered why all of a sudden. Maybe I would have felt relieved, thinking that I had avoided a crisis. But not now.

"This jerk, I'll beat him up and make him run away!"

While I'm still in my prime, Jang Leechu is undeniably a master at the peak of his skills. I admit that he is a few levels above me.

However, he shouldn't be able to go like this before the match is over.

I clenched my teeth, ignoring the pain in my nose, and focused all my strength on my lower body.

"Stay right there."

Swoosh! Bang!

With a loud noise, I leaped into the air.
A cold wind hit my face, and Jang Leechu's foot was right in front of me.
It was a distance where I could easily grab his ankle with my hand.
One conviction flashed through my mind.

"I've got him."

Pause!

But the sword slash I swung with a triumphant smile just cut through the empty air.
I blinked in disbelief for a moment.

"How?"

Even if my martial arts skills were at a low level, I knew the law of gravity. Jang Leechu's body was already at the highest point and descending, and I was rising with the force I received.
It was definitely a distance where I could even grab his ankle with my bare hands.

But I was too absorbed in that certainty and missed the most important fact.

A martial artist, especially a master, is a being that defies common sense.

"You crazy..."

Swearing involuntarily through my clenched lips, I saw a scene that was as shocking as it gets.

Banda! There was nothing there, not even a wall or a nail, just an empty void.

As if there were invisible stairs, Jang Leechu was soaring higher and higher, surpassing the sky.

"Is this a trick of the void...?"

Have I ever seen such a ridiculous case? How can I catch that?

Amidst my swearing, I saw the bewildered faces of people falling with me.

And among them, there was an old man with a cold gleam in his eyes.

"You bastard! How dare you!"

Hwawang Jeokcheon-gang.

With his roaring voice that shook the heavens, a red beam of light shot from his wrinkled hand. The force of Hwanyang 0809) propelled the sword, reaching the target over dozens of feet.

Gugugugung!

The trembling of the air, the flash that burst out from the void, pierced my retina. I closed my eyes and saw Jang Leechu falling towards me.

No, I have to correct it.

"That's not a fall."

Unfortunately, this time my prediction was correct.

It was the result of Jeokcheon-gang's incredible speed and Jang Leechu's use of his new technique.

"I blocked it."

Jang Leechu not only blocked Jeokcheon-gang's sword but also used the immense force behind it to accelerate in the direction he desired.

It was an incredibly intelligent and efficient decision made in a short moment.

Sshaaaak!

Jang Leechu shot down from the pitch-dark sky like a meteor, and at that moment, no one could stop him.

Tadak.

As I experienced the force of gravity firsthand and landed in the devastated ground, Jeokcheon-gang's enraged voice echoed around me.

"Go after him, you fools! Chase him immediately!"

Given the quick turn of events, Jeokcheon-gang's order finally made the reality sink

 in for the leaders of the Sangseok. They started to move.

"Capture Sangseung Sword Jang Leechu!"

"Suppress the power of the evil sect Ma Gyo! I will reward handsomely anyone who captures him, regardless of life or death!"

Gupa-ilbang and Odese's grandmasters. In addition to them, influential martial arts factions from various regions were present. The people gathered here were all key figures who moved the world of martial arts.

Naturally, their followers were also top-notch martial artists.

"Protect the leader!"

Hundreds of followers moved in all directions. At their forefront were me, Jeokcheon-gang, and several other leaders.

Sssshaaak!

We were ahead of everyone else. While I couldn't stand side by side with Jeokcheon-gang, the supreme expert who mastered the Solitary Path of the Exclusive Gate of the Yeolhwamun (4-\) up to the 9th level, I was able to keep up with him.

"Without teeth, it's just gums."

Although my mastery of the new martial arts was still low, and my martial skills were still at the edge of their peak, my body had already surpassed its limits.

"Are you injured? Are you okay?"

"I can endure it."

At that moment, as I turned my head towards Jeokcheon-gang's voice, which could be heard beyond the sound of the fierce wind...

Ding.

- According to the rules, [?7| has been eliminated from the unarmed competition first!

- Quest [Grand Martial Arts Tournament] has been successfully completed!

- Congratulations on achieving the great achievement of [Grand Martial Arts Tournament Victory]!

- Different rewards will be given based on the participants' levels and the difficulty of the competition!

- Earned a significant amount of experience points, reputation, and additional points!

- Level up!

- Level up!

- Level up!

Ding. Ding. Ding.

With the system notifications that dug into my mind without a break, changes began. Vitality surged through my exhausted body, and the injuries that were stabbing my body were neatly healed. The exhausted Dragon of Fire and Thunder, who had lost his strength in an all-out attack and defense, emerged from the battlefield.

"I never thought I would win the Grand Martial Arts Tournament like this. But I wasn't given the luxury of checking the system messages.

Finding the disappeared Jang Leechu was a top priority.

"Damn it, that guy is ridiculously fast, even though I don't know who he is."

Jang Leechu was so fast that it surpassed imagination, just like Manyichuhaeng (Poppo 1677), the master of open-handed combat and martial arts.

His figure had already disappeared from everyone's sight a long time ago. Jeokcheon-gang quickly gave orders.

"We'll lose him like this. Gaebang will cover the west, Gonryunpa and the rest will fill in the gaps."

"Understood, sir."

Crack!

Gaebang and Gonryunpa. Under the command of the grandmasters of the two martial arts factions known for their divine techniques, their disciples disappeared.

Jeokcheon-gang stared at the Wall Technique Master.

"You are in charge of the east."

"What about this place?"

"Nobo will handle it."

The Wall Technique Master opened his mouth with a stern expression.

"Be careful. That guy with the Rising Sword... it won't be easy to deal with him alone."

Difficult to deal with? These words came from the mouth of the Wall Technique Master, who is known for his pride and stubbornness.

Interpreted, it meant that Jang Leechu was a master who could rival or even surpass the Ten Kings.

"If Jang Leechu is at that level..."

How did he reach such a level at his age?

There is no other monster like this monster.

While I was still amazed, Jeokcheon-gang snorted and spoke.

"That kind of remark only applies to lowly scum like you. You shouldn't compare Nobo with the same level as you."

He said it as a joke, but it was clear that he didn't take the Wall Technique Master's words lightly.

Unlike his raised tail, Jeokcheon-gang's eyes were coldly sinking.

"I've had enough of your nonsense. Now go and see."

"What the hell. Even the sky is indifferent. Why did this fatso disappear at a time like this?"

We were ahead of everyone else. Although we couldn't match the skill of the divine martial artist Yeom Hwa-il, who had mastered the single-sword technique of the Yeolhwamun Gate up to level 9, we were able to keep up with him to some extent.

"If you don't have teeth, it's just gums."

Even though our mastery of the new martial arts was low and our martial skills were still at the peak of mediocrity, our extraordinary physical abilities allowed us to surpass our limits.

"Are you injured? Are you okay?"

"I can endure."

At that moment, when we heard Jeokcheon Gang's voice beyond the sound of the strong wind, we turned our heads.

Ding.

- According to the rules, [?7| has been disqualified for leaving the unarmed zone first!

- Quest [Grand Martial Arts Competition] has been successfully completed!

- You have achieved the great accomplishment of winning the [Grand Martial Arts Competition]!

- Different rewards will be given based on the participants' level and the difficulty of the competition!

- You have gained significant experience points, reputation, and additional points!

- Level up!

- Level up!

- Level up!

Ding. Ding. Ding.
With the system notifications ringing incessantly, changes began to occur along with the deepening of the martial arts system. Vitality surged in our exhausted bodies, and the wounds that had been nagging us were healed cleanly. With a powerful move, the exhausted dragon of Danjeon Martial Arts pushed off and leaped into the air.

"I never expected to win the Grand Martial Arts Competition like this. But I don't have the luxury to check system messages."

Finding the missing Jong Li-chu was our top priority.

"Damn it, whoever it is, they're damn fast."

Jong Li-chu was unbelievably fast, just as Po Po 1677, the renowned master of the Open Boat and Gonggong School, had described him.

We had lost sight of him a long time ago. Jeokcheon Gang quickly gave orders.

"We can't lose him like this. Gwang-ryunpa, take care of the western area, and Gonryunpa and the others fill in the gaps."

"Understood, Captain."

Thud!

With the Gwang-ryunpa and Gonryunpa leading their disciples, members of the two prestigious martial arts factions disappeared. Jeokcheon Gang, the Lord of the Wall's Thunderclap King, glared at the direction where they had gone.

"You are in charge of the east."

"What about here?"

"Nobu will take care of it."

The Thunderclap King opened his mouth with a stern expression.

"Be careful. That fellow, with his Rising Sword... It'll be tough to handle him alone."

Tough to handle? Coming from the Thunderclap King, who was known for his pride, it was a remark that even the second most powerful person would find disheartening.

In other words, Jong Li-chu was a formidable expert, on par with the Ten Kings or even stronger.

"To think Jong Li-chu is that powerful."

How did he reach such a level at his age? There was no other monster like him.

While I was still in awe, Jeokcheon Gang chuckled and spoke.

"That's a comment that only applies to people like you. Don't compare Nobu to the same level."

Although he said it jokingly, it was clear that Jeokcheon Gang did not take the Thunderclap King's words lightly.

With his raised tail contrasting his eyes, Jeokcheon Gang's gaze remained cold.

"You can stop with the flattery now and

 focus on the situation at hand. The enemy is approaching."

The sound of explosions and clouds of dust rose in the distance, heralding the enemy's arrival. The screams and calls to arms echoed from all directions.

I sharpened my senses and gathered information.

"About five hundred meters west. That's the direction with an opening."

It was a distance that could be reached in a blink of an eye by fully exerting our skills.

"Noyeon."

"I know."

Bang!

Jeokcheon Gang and I shot forward like bullets.

With each step we took, the surroundings, which had been passing by swiftly, began to change. The countless buildings that stretched endlessly started to diminish one by one, revealing towering fortress walls.

As we ran, defying the fierce wind pressure, a heavy feeling settled in my chest.

"What is this feeling?"

Was it the pressure of facing Jong Li-chu again?

I glanced to the side for a moment and saw Jeokcheon Gang's expression, frozen and resolute. There was an unmistakable sense of danger in his face.

And a moment later, we could see the tangible form of that indescribable emotion.

"Chase him!"

"Captain! Get a hold of yourself, Captain!"

More than thirty huge craters appeared, lined up like bombs. Amidst the gathering disciples of the Open Boat, corpses drenched in blood were revealed.

"Jung...?"

Jeokcheon Gang's footsteps, upon discovering a familiar face, came to an abrupt halt.

※ ※ ※

Jeokcheon Gang disappeared into the distance.

'An issue has arisen. I need to temporarily leave.'

"Now?"

"I'll be back soon."

"Is it something minor or major?"

"Amida Buddha. As the Buddha said, if you resolve the big issue first, the small issue will also be resolved."

"Damn Amida Buddha. So, you're going to deal with a big issue."

"If it's the Buddha, what does it matter? If it's Pang Jung, what difference does it make?"

"Hehehe."

I vividly remember the moment he laughed before leaving.

But why...

'Why is he doing this here?'

Clank.

Mud and blood splattered. The beggars surrounding the fallen man stepped back and bowed their heads.

"Enemy... approaching!"

"Bangju is chasing Jong Li-chu. B-but it was already too late when we arrived..."

"Step aside."

The voice that flowed through Jeokcheon Gang's lips was as dry as the remaining ash.

All sounds seemed to fade away, and the world came to a standstill. His senses were solely focused on one person.

"I'm here."

The usual greeting, but instead of a cheerful voice, a strained cough responded.

Cough. With a thump in his chest, dark blood trickled from Baengwang Gwongdo's mouth.
Serious injuries. It was evident that his internal organs were in a dire state, possibly even with fragments mixed in.

"Damn it, can't you hold yourself back while your friend is here?"

Jeokcheon Gang casually spoke as Baengwang Gwongdo slumped heavily to the ground.

As I gripped the wrist of the blood-soaked man, I could feel the energy flowing out. No chance of recovery. Those four heavy words filled Jeokcheon Gang's mind.

"Do you remember when we first met? It was at Gamsuk, when we were fighting against the Maegyo bastards."

Whether he was listening or just barely hearing, everyone harbored the same question, but Jeokcheon Gang continued without paying any attention.

"At first, I thought, 'Who is this fatty?' But as time went on, I realized that you were an annoyingly lovable guy."

Although it was never explicitly said, among the friends he opened his heart to, only Gwongdo was special.

A master had to be a reliable disciple, and to the first disciple he accepted, he had to be a dependable master.

But it was different with Gwongdo. By his side, he could become the insignificant Jeokcheon Gang and be just a human.

"Do you know that?"

Jeokcheon Gang directed his energy towards Baengwang Gwongdo's meridians while speaking in a hoarse voice.

"You are my best friend."

The breathing that seemed like it could stop at any moment became comfortable, and the eyelids that seemed bound to remain closed fluttered open.

Huigwang Banjo. Jeokcheon Gang stared at the grayish eyes of Gwongdo, where the last flame of life flickered, and spoke.

"Say whatever you want. Anything is fine."

The lips of Baengwang Gwongdo, stained with blood, twitched slightly. His expression changed rapidly as Jeokcheon Gang gazed at him, as if listening to his final words.

Anger, shock, realization.

And finally, the emotion that surfaced at the end was sadness.

Stroke. Thump.

The cough mixed with his voice became faint. The restless chest and trembling eyelids settled comfortably.

With a satisfied smile on his lips, as if he had fallen asleep, Gwongdo closed his eyes, and Jeokcheon Gang stared at him silently.

6 beams of light. Overwhelming like lava, his voice emerged as a dream.
