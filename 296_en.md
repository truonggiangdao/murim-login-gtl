How much time has passed?

I can't remember my name, my family, my friends, or even where I was born and what kind of life I lived.

After a long and deep darkness, I suddenly regained consciousness and found myself in a forest.

"Where am I?"

The question was fleeting.

Soon, I was consumed by the instinct of a monster and started fighting aimlessly. I fought against humans, once my own kind, and even fought against monsters.

Once a skilled knight in his past life, I grew stronger as I cultivated my magical powers. I surpassed even the dark sorcerer who controlled all the undead in the vast black forest.

Crack!

The fallen knight became the new master of the black forest. And he rose as the chosen one.

Commander of the Skeleton Legion, the Skeleton Warlord, became his new name.

"Was this how it felt?"

It was astonishing. Everything surrounding him had transformed. For some unknown reason, the magical power flowing through the black forest had become even more potent, and his skeletal body, all that remained, overflowed with immense strength.

To him, who had been reborn as a new being, the small groups of humans were utterly insignificant.

"They are few, and they are trembling in fear."

For humans, death is another name for fear.

To him, who had already become a dead being, the sight of humans in such a state was laughable.

"Run away. And bring me more lives!"

Now, he was the master of the black forest and the commander of the undead.

The larger groups of humans they brought would soon become his forces. If he could lead thousands, tens of thousands of undead under his command... the territory known as the black forest would not satisfy him anymore.

That would be the moment when he could rise not just as the commander of the undead but as a true lord.

"Leave this place and conquer a wider territory for me."

That was the plan.

Just then, as he looked with disdain at the fifty or so humans fleeing in panic, one human caught his eye.

"That guy..."

Surrounded by the Skeleton Knights, he was engaged in a frantic battle.

Strangely, unlike the other humans who spoke a strange language that he couldn't understand, he could comprehend every word that came out of this guy's mouth.

"It's fine! Go ahead!"

How is this possible? Such fluent Abyssal language.

Could this be a monster in the guise of a human?

All he wanted was to turn this seemingly competent human into an undead and add him to his ranks.

-엇르구구오인근이연

However, he should have known.

The foolish one was none other than himself.

"Phew, finally done."

= Yeowong2

He should have known that he shouldn't have brought all his forces into this narrow trail.

"All of you will die here. Well, that's all you need to know."

- Eun Lo 2?

The answer to the question soon became apparent.

"Ilseom (-)."

Crack!

As the fiery blue flames embraced the rising dragon's roar, the Skeleton Warlord felt a surge of approaching fear.

It was an emotion that had long been forgotten, a fear of death that had turned into a familiar companion rather than a dreaded enemy.

Before the Warlord could utter another word, the path was suddenly overwhelmed by the swirling azure flames, engulfing hundreds of skeletons.

"Oh no!"

- I've used up all my strength and energy!
- Status: Exhausted
- Defeated [/92. Skeleton Knight]!
- Earned a significant amount of experience points!
- Defeated [/75. Skeleton Warrior]!
- Earned a small amount of experience points!
- Defeated [[78. Skeleton Mage]!
- Earned a small amount of experience points!

Ding. Ding. Ding.

The system notifications continued to ring incessantly.

In an instant, my surroundings spun, and my legs wobbled. I managed to plunge the sharp edge of my spear into the ground, barely maintaining my balance.

"Darn it, I'm in trouble.

Ilsom is my only and most powerful skill. By using my strength and energy as the fuel, I can unleash an explosive force like never before.

Unlike before, as I advanced in my martial arts mastery, I gained the ability to control the power it grants. However, the aftermath still took a toll on me.

"Ilsom is just as dangerous as it is destructive. Without caution, I can't hope to survive for long.

Using the least amount of strength to achieve the greatest outcome is always the best strategy.

As someone who always seeks efficient battles, I couldn't afford to use Ilsom recklessly. A final move means that if I fail, there won't be another chance.

But this time, it was different.

"When else should I use it if not now?

A narrow path filled to the brim with countless monsters.

It was a stage perfectly crafted for me to unleash Ilsom. Though it resulted in the state of [Exhaustion] as the price for exerting my full power...

Every action has its contingency plans.

Ding.

- Massacre! Earned a tremendous amount of experience points!
- Leveled up!
- Obtained points!
- All status ailments have been restored!

Along with the awaited notifications, a refreshing sensation washed over me.

"Ohhh..."

Due to the aftermath of Ilsom, my exhausted body regained strength, and my trembling limbs steadied. The once hazy vision that was tinged with a pale hue brightened, revealing the outcome of Ilsom.

Wow, this is beyond my expectations.

I was taken aback by the scene unfolding before me.

Thud, thud.

The path, widened twice its size due to the power of Ilsom. The towering trees and rocks that once surrounded me were uprooted, and heaps of charred debris slowly burned on the blackened ground engulfed in flames.

"How many creatures did I send to their demise all at once?"

Although still breathing, or rather, already undead monsters, I should correct myself. Even so, they were nothing more than motionless beings, almost like they were in a state of combat incapacity.

"Did I defeat... around three hundred of them?"

I understood why the system labeled it as a "massacre."

Of course, the experience points were meager compared to the grandiose term used.

"Just one level up? Seriously."

With a sigh, I began dealing with the remaining skeletons.

It's frustrating to see each weak opponent when the required experience points for leveling up keep piling up like a mountain.

- 0707. Attached
Take that, Skeleton crawling on its two lost legs.

Ding.

- Defeated [44/73. Skeleton Warrior]!
- Earned a small amount of experience points!

Geez, they're really stingy with the experience points.

Muttering discontentedly, I turned my head to find the next monster when...

"Oh, ohh, could it be...!"

My eyes widened, and a warm feeling spread in my chest.

With an excited heart, I approached the figure stuck in the suction cup.

A skeleton whose head was the only thing left, trembling weakly.

The green flame that had burned brightly like a torch had now shrunk to a feeble flicker, but it was enough to recognize its identity.

[!/.105 Skeleton Warlord]

I smiled widely and extended my hand towards the skull.

"Nice to meet you, my friend!"

"So, you were here! You should have said something earlier! Why were you just standing there?"

- Attached 2742
You deceitful little thing, pretending to be a Skeleton Warrior, huh?

With a disappointed expression, I gripped the spear's hilt.

"Oh, well. You're just a weakling. I guess I'll just kill you."

- False
"You can speak. Could it be?"

- What's going on here?
The Skeleton Warlord opened his eyes and spoke.

- Master, we did it! You were amazing!
"Wow! Warlord!"

- Can I join the battle too?
"Wow! Experience points!"

- Something seems off.
Feeling uneasy, the Warlord urgently spoke.

- Is it worth killing this nuisance?
This guy... He's getting desperate, that's why he's trying to sound smooth.

"Who said anything about killing? You're already dead."

- This nuisance thinks he can defeat me. He's delusional.
"Have you read any books on empathy, you insolent fool?"

As I stared at him in disbelief, the Warlord clenched his jaw.

- Can we make a deal?
"Deal?"

- I have some valuable items to offer.
"I propose something first."

- What can I get from you?
"Tell me what you can offer. I'll listen and decide."

The Warlord remained silent, seemingly lost in thought, then finally responded.

- I can offer you a portion of the forest, about 70% of it.
"The Black Forest is ours."

- It doesn't matter, I have exclusive gate rights.
"Well, no. I prefer hunting monsters that respawn."

- What about giving me the authority to control the gate?
"Sure. I'm actually considering sending one of them right now."

With a firm grip on the creature's head, I heard the Warlord's urgent and trembling voice.

- What if we don't hear anything from you?
"By the way, can someone without a snail's ear hear anything? Quite intriguing."

- What if we reach a total of 200 deaths?
"Wow! Such sweet experience points!"

- And what about the monster's loot?
"I'm curious! What can I get from them?"

- We'll figure it out later, let's focus for now.
"Calm down!"

The Warlord's voice shook as he anxiously shouted.

- What about the 200 explosive traps and 78 poison arrows?
"By the way, can someone without a snail's ear hear anything? Quite intriguing."

- What if we eliminate 99 gold and 70 silver?
"Wow! So much experience!"

- And what if I use my special move?
"What if I use my special move?"

- This guy's attitude changed instantly.
"Fascinating!"

Having a conversation with monsters like this was a first, and it felt quite refreshing. But it was time to stop fooling around.

"Inventory open. Summon dagger."

Swoosh.
A gleaming blade appeared before me.

As I faced the shimmering sword, the Warlord asked with a worried tone:

- What's the value of this encounter?
"Oh, nothing special. Just close your eyes and stay still. It'll be over soon."

- Stay still and watch.
"Okay, fine. Just stay still. If any bones are severed, their value will plummet."

- The wyvern and one-eyed Carus I defeated earlier turned into gold nuggets, but I'm not sure which part of this skeleton's body is valuable.

"But still, wouldn't a skull ornament from a named monster sell for a high price?"

Even though it's decayed, the bone's surface gleams with a black luster, quite beautiful.

First, I planned to completely annihilate it and then collect the bones from nearby.

- It's been a while since we've faced something like this.
Thunk! Clatter clatter clatter!

Ah, that guy sure is noisy.

Just as I was about to firmly grab the Warlord's jaw, which was shaking up and down without any reason...

- Hold on, don't move!
"Hmm. Well, if you're willing to accept it now, will you stay still? Besides, you don't even know what experience points are."

- As far as I've heard, bones can fetch a good price.
"What nonsense. They're not commodities."

I paused as I was about to speak. It was because a thought flickered through my mind.

Could this actually work?

- You're the owner of the Black Forest, right?
"Ninety-nine percent."

- How many subordinates do you have?
"All of them. There's no need to differentiate. They're just a bunch of cannon fodder."

- So, around a thousand?
"Are there a thousand?"

- And is there anything special about you?
"I am the Skeleton Warlord."

- Alright, I have something to propose. Let's work together.
"Ninety-nine percent."

- What kind of work?
"There's something like that. Just do as I say."

My disdainful laughter made the Warlord's skull tremble.
