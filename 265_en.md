I definitely, definitely thought I was dead.
Even if I wasn't completely lifeless, I was convinced that it was a state where I couldn't be considered a living human anymore.
Snap. The sound of impact!
It's an unbelievable sight to see.
The skin, which seemed like it would crumble if touched, is now covered with smooth flesh, and the protruding bones have returned to their place, filling the cavities.

"What is this?

What should I call this? Recovery?
No, this is regeneration. It's a regenerative power that goes beyond the limits of human beings, almost like a monster.

In astonishment, Cheongpung let out a sigh.

"Ah, ah..."

Meanwhile, the final transformation has ended. The face, which had exposed the muscles, quickly regenerated.
Snap. The person who touched his neck chuckled at us.

"I should have broken his neck. Definitely."

Cheongpung, who was frozen like a statue, barely moved his lips.

"Shut up, Hyeolju. Just shut up. It's the same for all of you, who belong to the same faction anyway."

"Yes, you... cough."

Overwhelmed, I supported Cheongpung. His pale face, with blood running down his chin, looked disgusted.

I was wrong. Cheongpung had already exhausted all his strength.

Now that even the last resort, the manifestation of the divine spirit, has turned out to be in vain, what lies in my arms is not the King of Fire but a tired old man.

"Please, help me..."

Cheongpung couldn't continue speaking and shook his head. He urgently checked his pulse, and although it was faint, it was still beating.

"You're still fine."

But it was too much to breathe a sigh of relief.

"From what I see, even the King of Fire is only capable of this much."

Hyeolju took a step forward with a joyful expression.

-It was more interesting than I expected. No, to be honest, it was surprising. I didn't think it would go this far."

"You're a pain in the ass. Shut up."

I grabbed the white fur that was hanging loosely and stood up from my seat.

Cheongpung was already exhausted from the battle. If he exhausts more strength here... it will be an irreversible disaster.

"Do you think you can stop me alone? Admirable thought."
"I suppose you switched places with that cowardly rat? It's the two of us."

Hyeolju nodded his head.

"No, it's just one. I won't consider a cowardly rat like you as a human."

A cowardly rat?

I turned my head to the side. Cheongpung, frozen in place, came into view.

Unsteadily trembling pupils. The hand holding the sword trembled uncontrollably.

"Fear."

That was the only emotion I could sense from Cheongpung right now.

"He still hasn't overcome his timidity and sent the greenhorn to the tiger's den. The Sword Saint really spoiled his disciple."

Jebuk.

Still a considerable distance away from unconsciousness. But as Hyeolju took a step forward, Cheongpung startled like someone thrown into a fire and stepped back.

"This is... a momentary sense of disappointment settled in my chest. Because I know exactly what it means.

I have experienced it myself, and many others have walked this path. Now Cheongpung is walking it belatedly.

"Of all times, why now?"

If it were a nobody, a hunter, it would be a growth pain that everyone experiences, but for the genius in front of me, it was too late for that stage.

Hyeolju read the thought that appeared on my face and smiled.

"You know too, right? You're already in a hopeless situation. It's not easy to escape once you're caught in the feeling of powerlessness, the fear of death."

"...Jongrichu."

No doubt about it. It's because of the fight with Jongrichu.

He is the one who planted the seed of fear in Cheongpung. And that seed met another strong person, Hyeolju.

"Yeah, you know. That guy caused a big trouble. Thanks to him, the attention of the factions, including the Cheongpung faction, has been drawn, and even the disciple of the Sword Saint. Haha!"

My mouth twitched as if it were filled with sand.

Cheongpung was still terrified, and Hyeolju was narrowing the distance with a leisurely pace.

"Damn it."

Fortunately, I still have one last move left. The problem is that it's truly the 'final' move.

Even if I succeed, I can't guarantee the outcome, and if I fail, all that's left is death.

"But there's no room for choice."

I slowly raised my remaining strength. A decisive strike that pours all my power into it is the only way to crush his head.

Can I do it? I extinguished the thought of whether I could or not.

"I have to do it. Somehow."

With determination rather than doubt. With a resolute will rather than certainty. I have to move, risking my life with each small movement, so that there's a slight chance of success.

"Cheongpung!"

Thud. Thud.

Even without looking, I knew. It was the sound of Cheongpung's teeth grinding. I shouted with all my strength.

"Cheongpung!"

With a snort, Cheongpung raised his head.

"I won't say it twice. Listen carefully and decide for yourself."

"Y-Yes?"

"You have two choices. First, give up and run as far away as possible, abandoning everything."

"Option one."

"I haven't finished speaking yet. Second, cast aside your trembling like a cowardly brat and fight with all your might against him, even if it means dying alongside me."

Shivers. I felt a commotion in Cheongpung's trembling breath. And then, the steps that had retreated a few paces moved forward again.

Jebuk. We stood side by side in front of the confused Jeongcheon River.

"Bold. I haven't heard yet."

"This is my answer."

"Honestly."

"I'm scared, Eunin."

"Damn it, you're brutally honest."

"But it's really scary. It's the first time I've felt like this in my life."

I fixed my gaze on the approaching Hyeolju and asked while keeping my eyes on him.

"If you're so scared, why don't you run away?"

"I don't know either. I just feel like I'll regret it for the rest of my life if I run away here."

Regret. I know what it means.

I glanced at Cheongpung. He was still trembling, his hand shaking, but his steps forward were resolute. He wouldn't retreat, firmly rooted.

Yes, this is enough for now. It was the moment I realized that, nodding slightly.

"Regret? Running away?"

Twenty steps away. Hyeolju, who had stopped walking, laughed as if he had heard a hilarious joke.

"Novices spout foolish words. That's my decision. It's the right of the strong and the inevitability of the weak."

"Well, some parts of what you said are right, but..."

I raised the spear and struck him. The transparent blade of Baekryeom shattered under the sunlight.

"Why do all of your words sound the same?"

"The truth is uncomfortable. Especially for the weak."

"It won't work. Open your mouth wider, patient. I'm starting the circumcision surgery. It'll hurt a bit without anesthesia with a spear."

"Phuhahaha!"

"You're laughing? You don't seem like the type. But that's how the world works. I should've realized it when my mom asked me to go eat something delicious."

The smile on his lips soured.

"Sanseo Jammong. The more I see, the more interesting you become. A mysterious martial artist with extraordinary skills... I like it."

"If you like it?"

"Come under me. I might spare the Fire King for you."

"Stop talking nonsense. There's no chance I'll negotiate with scum like

 you."

"Who said such a thing? Once is a coincidence. Twice is fate. The third meeting is destiny."

"You're writing a romance novel and falling for it."

Hyeolju seemed pleased with himself.

"Write it. It may not be a romantic relationship, but if we've encountered each other twice in this vast world, it might be considered a connection."

"Twice?"

I didn't understand for a moment.

What the hell is that bastard talking about?

"You, by any chance, have you seen me at the Sungla Conference?"

"Of course. I saw you."

A mischievous voice filled the air.

"At the Eight Thousand Alliance."

"What...?"

"Minister, they said. The corpses turning into mountains, blood flowing like rivers...~ The sight of you taking Jinbaekyang's life was particularly impressive. Maybe that's when you were called Sanseo Jammong?"

"What are you talking about now...?"

"Hwayang Sword Jinbaekyang. He was a useless fool. At first, he acted like he could handle anything and everything, like a clever and capable person, but as time went on, he started making mistakes out of the same old hesitation. I wonder which incompetent fool recruited such a clumsy guy. Pathetic."

I stared blankly at the smirking Hyeolju. Every word that came out of his mouth sounded hollow and unfamiliar.

"Oh, is that third-rate faction called Hangsan Sword Sect still around? I heard a report that they killed one of the lower-ranked disciples. But since the Eight Thousand Alliance, I haven't had any interest in them."

.. 20]

A shiver ran down my spine like being pierced by lightning.

"Then, what about you?"

Hyeolju's eyes curved like a half-moon. A soft voice, completely unlike him, followed.

"One time is a coincidence. Two times is fate. What do you think? Isn't our encounter something more than just a coincidence?"

I couldn't breathe for a moment.

The person in front of me right now was the one who caused that war.

Hyeolju looked at my expression and chuckled.

"Why the face? Thanks to you, I feel refreshed. Taewon's true value lies in Sanseo. Since you also became the disciple of the Fire King and won the Sungla Great Competition, you should at least give me a word of thanks, shouldn't you?"

I didn't answer. My mind was filled with one thought.

"How many people died?"
I don't know. A thousand? Two thousand?

Countless people met their deaths in a meaningless war. There were no clear winners or losers.

There were just mindless soldiers who swung their weapons as ordered, innocent civilians who had no connection to the war, and the orphans of war who were left behind.

The martial artists of Sanseo stumbled, and the demons of the plateau roared. The same history repeated itself shortly after the war ended.

"But a word of thanks..."

I gritted my dry lips. Power surged into the hand holding the spear.

A force unknown to me surged through my exhausted body. It was an attribute that didn't show up in the system window.

It was anger.

"I...!"

"Coincidence? Fate? Nonsense like that."

I sighed deeply. If I didn't do that, it felt like flames would burst out of my mouth.

"You and I are different cases. Let's skip all that and call it destiny."

"Destiny?"

"Yeah. You'll become one of the two pigs of destiny."

Before he finished speaking, I lunged towards him. The blade of the spear sliced through the air.

“This bastard!”

Cheongpung turned his head in the direction of the sound. In his tilted vision, he saw two warriors locked in combat.

No, it couldn't be called a fight anymore.

! ! !

"Hmm!"

"Are you saying you won't die like this? Even like this?"

Thud! Thud!
His nasal bone sank. His ankle broke, and his shoulder dislocated.

Once, twice, ten times...
But no matter what injuries he sustained, no matter how many times he fell, he would rise again.

Even a hundred times, it would be the same.
The young man Cheongpung knew was that kind of person.

~
Contrary to hope, reality was cold.

The outcome was quickly decided.

I don't know what martial arts he practiced, but Jintaekyeong's strike was so powerful that it was unmatched. It shattered the opponent's Hyeolju infused with vitality and struck his body.

However, in just a short moment, Hyeolju recovered his body and cornered them.

"You crazy bastard, there's no one like you in the world."

Now everything is about to end.

With a disgusted expression, Hyeolju lowered his head, his whole body covered in blood.

Unlike before, he couldn't heal his wounds. With laughter gone from his usual calm demeanor, he exhaled rough breaths and pulled out Jintaekyeong's spear, deeply embedded in the ground.

"Huh, hoo, oyah. Kill me."

To kill.

The moment Cheongpung heard those words, his palm touched the ground. The pain from his broken arms and legs, the sensation of blood flowing, it all felt like bursting open.

Only a floating sensation dominated his entire body.

'What's going on?

I don't know. At the end of his stumbling steps, there was Hyeolju.

"Heh, what's this again? Do you want to die too?"

His trembling hands faced Hyeolju's frenzied gaze.

But when he saw Jintaekyeong, who was collapsed behind Hyeolju, the trembling gradually subsided.

"A loyal servant, a loyal servant."

"Have you ever seen such crazy bastards?"

Hyeolju, who burst into a chilling laughter, swung his spear.

Swoosh!

Blood spurted from Cheongpung's chest as he staggered in front of him.

Thud.
But his steps didn't stop. He didn't collapse. From his weakened grasp, the sword handle slipped.

"What the hell is this?"

Hyeolju, with a bewildered expression, tightly gripped Cheongpung's neck with strong hands.

"Comac!"

"What's the matter? Why are you idiots making a fuss before dying?"

A voice filled with genuine curiosity.

Cheongpung opened his mouth within the fading consciousness. A feeble, suppressed voice emerged.

"Backing down... I would regret it for the rest of my life."

"Is that the reason? Such a cowardly brat like you has such a lame excuse for not backing down?"

The madness in his eyes intensified. But it was strange.

He wasn't afraid at all. It felt like going back to the days in Yeonhwa Peak, Cheongpung unconsciously raised the corners of his mouth.

"Hehe, yes."

Hyeolju's face contorted fiercely.
He laughed. He laughed in front of himself. It was an impossible thing, something that shouldn't happen.

"Farewell, I heard you well."

It was the voice that resembled the blue sky of a volcano that Cheongpung remembered.

Now he finally recognized that voice.
