I was certain that even if he wasn't completely dead, he couldn't be considered a living human anymore. 
Swoosh. Thud!
It was an unbelievable sight. The skin that seemed like it would crumble at the slightest touch was now covered in smooth flesh, and the protruding bones had found their place and fused together.

"What is this?
What should I call this? Regeneration?
No, it's more than that. This is resurrection. A regeneration power that goes beyond human limits, like a monster.

In awe of this astonishing sight, Qingfeng let out a sigh.

"Ah, ahh..."

In the meantime, the final transformation had ended. The face that had exposed even the muscles quickly regenerated.
Thud. The man who had touched his own neckbones laughed heartily towards us.

"I'll break your head for sure."

The rigid Jiechen River barely managed to move its lips.

"Naturally, as a Magus (let's call it that. It's all the same to you sect people, anyway."

"Yes, you... Gah!"

Overwhelmed, I supported Jiechen River. His pale complexion was tinged with white, and red blood dripped down his chin.

I was wrong. Jiechen River had already exhausted all his strength.

Gathering his last ounce of strength, he released his transformed manifestation, only for it to turn into ashes. Now, what remained in my arms was not the Flame King, but a weary old man.

"Hurry, heal him~"

Jiechen River struggled to speak, desperately checking his pulse. It was faint, but still beating.

"He's still okay."

But it was too early to breathe a sigh of relief.

"It seems even the Flame King has reached his limit."

With a joyful expression, Xueju took a step forward.

"It was more interesting than I expected. No, to be honest, it was exhilarating. I never thought it would come to this extent."

"You're getting cocky. Shut your mouth."

I stood up, wrapping my arm around Jiechen River.

Jiechen River was already drained from the battle. If he exhausts more strength here... then something irreversible will happen.

"You think you can stop me alone? Admirable thought."

"I'm not alone. There are two of us."

Xueju raised his head.

"No, only one. I don't consider a scared little rat like you a person."

A scared little rat? 

I turned my head to the side. Qingfeng, who was frozen, came into view.

His dilated pupils, trembling hands gripping the sword hilt, showed signs of fear.

"Fear."

That was the only emotion I could sense from Qingfeng right now.

"You sent a coward like him to the riverside, huh? The Sword Saint has raised his disciple to be so timid."

Thud.

Still at a considerable distance from overwhelming anger. However, when Xueju took a step forward, Qingfeng startled and stepped back.

"This is..."

In an instant, my heart sank. I knew exactly what it meant.

I had personally experienced it, and many others had walked this path before. Qingfeng was late in following.

"Why now, of all times."

Even if the breath wasn't completely cut off, I was certain that it was a state where one couldn't be considered a living human anymore.

Swoosh. Suddenly, out of nowhere!
It's an unbelievable sight to behold.
The skin, which seemed like it would crumble at the slightest touch, is now covered in smooth flesh, and the protruding bones have returned to their places.

"What is this?
What should I call this? Recovery?
No, it's regeneration. It's a regenerative power that goes beyond the boundaries of human capabilities, like a monster.

In awe of this astonishing sight, Cheongpo let out a sigh.

"Ah, ah..."

Meanwhile, the final transformation had ended. The face that had revealed muscles quickly regenerated.
Whoosh. The one who had touched his throat burst into laughter.

"I should have broken his neck. For sure."

Jeokcheon River, who had been frozen like a statue, managed to move his lips.

"Sheol, let's just call it that. It's all the same for people like you from different factions, right?"

"Yes, you... cough."

Overwhelmed, I supported Jeokcheon River. His pale complexion, with red blood trickling down his chin.

I was wrong. Jeokcheon River had already exhausted all his strength.
Now, in my embrace, there was not the Hwawang, but a tired old man.

"Quick, we need to save..."

Jeokcheon River couldn't finish his sentence and trembled. He urgently checked his pulse, and although faint, it was still beating.

"It's still okay."

However, it was a sigh of relief that came too soon.

"It seems even the Hwawang, the ruler of the world, has reached this point."

Hyeolju said with a joyful expression.

"It was more entertaining than I expected. Well, to be honest, it was quite shocking. I didn't expect it to come to this."

"Shut up, you piece of shit."

I stood up, grabbing Baekyeom, who had been lying there for a while.

Jeokcheon River was already in a state of combat readiness. If he expends any more strength here... it will lead to an irreversible outcome.

"You think you can stop me alone? Admirable thought."

"One eye replaced by shit? There are two of us."

Hyeolju shook his head.

"No, there's only one. I won't consider a cowardly rat like you a human."

A cowardly rat?

I turned my head to the side. Cheongpo, frozen in fear, came into view.

Restless pupils, trembling hand holding the sword.

"Fear."

That was the only emotion I could sense from Cheongpo at that moment.

"You send a frightened rookie like that to face me? Did the Gyeomseong raise you like a little mouse?"

Jebak.

Still quite a distance from vomiting. However, with one step from Hyeolju, Cheongpo recoiled as if he were on fire.

"This... is..."

In an instant, my heart sank. I knew exactly what it meant.

I have experienced it firsthand, and many others have walked this path. Cheongpo, belatedly, was walking it now.

"Of all times."

Twenty steps ahead, Hyeolju stopped walking and laughed as if he had heard a great joke.

"So, the rookies are babbling arrogantly. That's my decision. It's the right of the strong and the inevitability of the weak."

"Well, some parts of what you said are true, but... I stabbed him with my spear. The transparent blade of Baekyeom shattered into pieces under the sunlight."

"Why do all the words coming from your mouth sound like nonsense?"

"The truth is inconvenient, especially for the weak."

"It won't work. Open your patient's mouth wide. We're starting the circumcision surgery. It'll be a bit painful without anesthesia."

"Hahaha!"

"You're laughing? You don't seem like the type. But that's how life is. I should have realized it when Mom suggested going out for something delicious."

The laughter on his lips turned sour.

"Sanseo Jamryong. The more I see, the more interesting you become. Mysterious martial arts that cannot be identified, and you also have the guts... I like it."

"If you like it?"

"Come under my command. I might spare the Hwawang's life."

"Forget it. Enjoy your meal. Today will be the last time we meet, you bastard."

"Who said such things? Once is coincidence. Twice is fate. The third encounter is destiny."

"You're writing romance novels and getting carried away."

Hyeolju looked pleased.

"Write it. It may not be a romantic relationship, but if we've crossed paths twice in this vast world, wouldn't that be considered fate?"

"Twice?"

I didn't understand for a moment.

What is that bastard talking about now?

"You, have you seen me at the Sungla Daejeon?"

"Well, yeah. I've seen you."

His voice was full of mischief.

"At Pacheon Peak."

"What...?"

"He was the minister. The corpse turned into a mountain, blood turned into a river...~ Your act of taking Jinbaekyang's life was particularly impressive. Perhaps that's when you were called Sanseo Jamryong?"

"What are you talking about..."

"Hwayang Sword Jinbaekyang. He was a useless fool. At first, he acted like a big shot, getting rid of the small fry one by one, but he became more and more suspicious and ruined his work. I wonder who recruited such an incompetent person. Pathetic."

I stared blankly at the mocking Hyeolju. Every word that came out of his mouth felt empty and unfamiliar.

"Oh, is that third-rate martial sect called Hangsan Jamryong still around? I heard a report that they killed one of the lower-ranked disciple's sons. But since Pacheon Peak, I haven't been interested anymore."

.. 20]

A tingling sensation ran down my spine like being struck by lightning.

"Then, what about you?"

Hyeolju's eyes curved like a half-moon.
A soft voice that didn't match him at all followed.

"Once is a coincidence. Twice is fate. The third encounter is destiny. How about it? With us, isn't it fate?"

I couldn't breathe for a moment.

The person standing in front of me right now was none other than the mastermind behind that war.

Seeing my expression, Hyeolju chuckled.

"Why that expression? Thanks to you, I've relaxed. The true value of Taewon lies in Pacheon. And you, becoming the disciple of the Hwawang and winning the Sungla Daejeon, you should at least express your gratitude to me, shouldn't you?"

I didn't respond. My mind was filled with one thought.

"How many people died? I don't know. A thousand? Two thousand?"

Many people met their deaths in a meaningless war. There were no clear winners or losers.

Countless innocent civilians, unrelated to the conflict, wielded weapons as they were ordered, and war orphans were left behind.

The Sanseo martial artists staggered, and the highland bandits rose. It didn't take long after the war ended for history to repeat itself.

"But anyway, a word of thanks..."

I pressed my dry lips together. Strength naturally filled my grip on the spear. An unknown power surged through my exhausted body. An ability not displayed in the system window.

It was anger.

"I don't believe in that 'once is a coincidence, twice is fate' nonsense."

I sighed deeply. If I didn't do that, it felt like fireballs would spew from my mouth.

"You and I are different cases. Let's call it destiny and skip everything else."

"Destiny?"

"Yeah. You become either a pig or destiny."

Before he finished speaking, I lunged at the ground. The sword's edge sliced through the air.

Swish!

"Kraaack!"

His arm broke, and white bones jutted out from the flesh.

The young man let out a scream of agony he had never experienced before. The splattered blood landed on his tormentor's face.

A repulsive scent of blood filled the air. The thick leg swung, aiming for the young man's bent waist.

Thud!

"You pathetic fool. It's pitiful that someone like you became a disciple of Gomsung."

The fallen young man, Cheongpung, struggled to turn his body with great effort.

It hurts. I want to collapse. Screaming in pain from head to toe, a deep sense of despair weighed heavily upon him.

"My body... My body won't listen."

In the end, he couldn't get up and slumped down in exhaustion. His gaze widened to take in the vast expanse of the sky.

The sky seen from Hwasaan Yeonhwabong was always clear and beautiful. Clouds during the day, stars at night, and deer and rabbits leaping energetically.

But.

"Why is the sky here so red?"

The young man blinked his eyes, realizing that the blood vessels in his eyes had burst. It was the first time his blood vessels had burst, but he wasn't surprised.

"My bones have already broken, and I've shed so much blood."

As he thought about his own appearance, his breathing involuntarily became rapid.

As Cheongpung lay sprawled on the ground, gasping for breath, a sharp sound pierced the air.

Shing! Crash!

"Kuheok!"

"This bastard!"

Cheongpung turned his head toward the direction of the noise. His tilted vision revealed two figures engaged in a fierce battle.

No, it couldn't be called a fight anymore.

!!!

"Hmm!"

"You still won't die? Even like this?"

Thud! Crash!
His nose sank in. His ankle broke, and his shoulder dislocated.

Once, twice, ten times...
But no matter what injuries he sustained, no matter how many times he fell, he would get up again.

Even a hundred times would be the same.
Because that's who Cheongpung's acquaintance was.

~
Reality was cold, unlike hope.

The outcome was quickly decided.

I don't know what martial art he used, but Jin Taekyeong's strike was powerful beyond compare. It shattered the opponent's vital energy meridian, even with the infusion of vitality, and inflicted a blow on his body.

However, in a matter of moments, the vital energy in his body recovered, and he cornered them.

"You crazy fools, there's no one like you in the world."

Now everything was about to end.

With a weary expression, Hyeolju faced down, his body covered in blood.

Unlike before, he couldn't heal his wounds. His laughter, which was always relaxed, disappeared, and he breathed heavily, clutching the spear embedded in Jin Taekyeong's chest.

"Hm, who's next? Do you want to die too?"

When Cheongpung met his fierce gaze, his hand trembled.

But as he saw Jin Taekyeong lying behind Hyeolju, his trembling subsided.

"Brother, brother..."

"Have you ever seen such crazy bastards?"

Hyeolju watched that sight with a puzzled look.

With a strong grip, Hyeolju lifted the spear from Cheongpung's neck.

"What's this?"

He watched in astonishment as the spear slipped from his weakened grip.

"What the hell..."

With a perplexed expression, Hyeolju's face contorted.

He laughed. Laughed at himself. It was an impossible and unacceptable situation.

"You're afraid, aren't you?"

His voice resonated clearly.

Cheongpung, in a state of fading consciousness, opened his mouth. A feeble and suppressed voice emerged.

"I don't want to live my life regretting if I retreat..."

"Is that your reason? Such a pathetic excuse for a coward like you."

His murderous intent intensified. But it was strange.

He felt no fear at all. It was as if he had returned to the days spent on Mount Yeonhwa, and without realizing it, Cheongpung's lips curled up.

"Hehe, you're right."

Hyeolju's face contorted fiercely.

He laughed. Laughed in front of Cheongpung. It was an impossible and forbidden act.

"Farewell, I heard you well."

It was at that moment, as Hyeolju was about to thrust the spear into Cheongpung's chest.

"Cowardice suits you."

A clear voice resounded.

Cheongpung felt the spear's blade pressing against his chest.

"Shaking in fear."

It was a voice that resembled the clear blue sky of the volcano.

Only now did he recognize that voice.

Finally.
