The collapsed new model wriggled and regained strength shortly after.

Struggling with groans, Lee Jung-ryong barely opened his eyes and asked Seok Go-joon.

"Are you awake?"

"...I'm sorry. I should have bought more time."

Seok Go-joon bowed his head with a stern face.
What he had done to Jin Tae-kyung was not a spontaneous act. As Lee Jung-ryong's disciple and head of the security team, Seok Go-joon, with exceptional composure and self-restraint, did it because of the orders of a respected master.

"Jin Tae-kyung. I need to see his true ability."
"How can I do that?"

"Buy as much time as possible. Uncover his true nature.

"I never liked him from the beginning. I guess I can handle him properly."
He shouldn't have said those last words.

After boldly expressing his thoughts, he couldn't withstand even a single blow. He had no face to face Lee Jung-ryong.

"You've experienced it firsthand, so you must have learned something. Speak without reservation about his abilities."

It didn't take long for Seok Go-joon to speak up.

"He's strong."

It was Jin Tae-kyung who had sent a message to the Myeongdong Guild. He knew he wasn't an easy person.

However, even after being hit with a mana-infused fist, he not only didn't fall but also didn't take a step back. Seok Go-joon hadn't expected the owner of such an ignorant house.

"I accurately assessed his strength, but he was stronger than steel. I've never seen someone like him."

He couldn't understand how someone could be so powerful without wearing armor or casting defensive magic.

The bigger problem was that Jin Tae-kyung was not just a person with a good physique.

"Strength, speed. He was superior to me in every aspect."

"What if Team Leader Seok had used his full power from the beginning?"

Seok Go-joon, who was thinking for a moment, answered in a firm voice.

"...It would have been difficult."

He recalled Jin Tae-kyung's lightning-fast movements.

In an instant, his arm was caught and his foot firmly planted on the ground. He urgently raised his arm to protect his face, but the powerful punch landed on his arm and hit his face.

"I don't know how he did it, but Jin Tae-kyung has extensive practical experience. He's on a different level from ordinary hunters who only fight monsters."

"And?"

"Well..."

"Isn't there something else you haven't said?"

"I remember telling you to speak without reservation."

Seok Go-joon, catching Lee Jung-ryong's gaze, realized that he had the same thought.

"You already suspected."

"Yeah. That suspicion has now turned into certainty."

Lee Jung-ryong's voice lowered.

"I can't hear you. Jin Tae-kyung has mastered the art of mana manipulation."

Suahi,
Mana manipulation.

A small ripple appeared in Seok Go-joon's unwavering eyes. The words that came

 out of Lee Jung-ryong's mouth were that astonishing.

"I've never seen a low-ranking hunter like Jin Tae-kyung grow so much in just half a year. People may speculate and say it was a measurement error, but those are just words from ignorant people."

Seok Go-joon muttered like a sigh.

"But how... isn't the art of mana manipulation an extremely secret technique?"

"Secret? That's a meaningless word. As long as someone knows it, there's no such thing as a perfect secret."

"Is it Chief Choi Min-woo's doing?"

Lee Jung-ryong shook his head.

"Min-woo, that kid didn't learn the art of mana manipulation. The same goes for Kim Hwa-jong, who kept his vow since he was young."

"No one knows about it? What if the guild leader..."

Who?"
Seok Go-joon couldn't continue his words and froze in place.

As their eyes met the deeply sunken pupils of Yi Jeongryung, Seok Gojun realized that he had said something he shouldn't have.

"I must not speak lightly about Hyungnim."

"I-I apologize. I made a slip of the tongue..."

Seok Gojun's voice faded like a dying breath.

Startled by the mention that Jin Taekyeong had mastered the Mana Martial Arts, he broke the unwritten rule. Guild Master Cheon Tae-min of the Ares Guild should never be mentioned.

Seok Gojun fell to his knees. He bowed deeply and spoke.

"I beg your forgiveness, Deputy Guild Master."

"Forgiveness? In life, such things can happen."

"Please rise."

Carefully lifting his knees and sitting back in place, Seok Gojun couldn't bring himself to look directly at Yi Jeongryung.

Until now, he had witnessed and learned many things while following his resolve.

For Seok Gojun, Yi Jeongryung was an object of respect and fear.

His face, always expressionless like a machine, now bore a subtle fear.

"Listen, Team Leader Seok."

It was Yi Jeongryung who broke the suffocating silence.

Seok Gojun's head bowed even deeper.

"Yes, Deputy Guild Master. Please speak."

"We will become busier in the future. If you casually utter words like this, I will find myself in a great dilemma."

"I will remember, and remember again."

"We will strengthen the surveillance of the Peace Guild. See if there are any useful individuals."

Seok Gojun cautiously lifted his head.

"Do you plan to reinforce the security team?"

"Yes, things cannot continue like this. We must be prepared for any unforeseen circumstances."

"Understood. I will implement it as soon as I return to the guild."

"And... do not overlook the activities of the executives. Including the overseas branches."

"I will execute it without any gaps."

Yi Jeongryung's position within the Ares Guild was already well-established.

However, not everyone blindly followed him.

There were always dissatisfied individuals present, and they cast suspicious glances at Yi Jeongryung's actions.

On the other hand, the security team was essentially Yi Jeongryung's personal bodyguards.

Well-paid and trained in mana martial arts, the security team showed absolute loyalty to Yi Jeongryung alone.

"Yes, we have been too peaceful all this time."

Yi Jeongryung turned his gaze outside the window.

Beyond the spotless glass, the wide Han River spread out, free of a single speck of dust. The river that had been filled with the corpses of humans and monsters just thirty years ago now looked pure and clean, as if saying, "When did that happen?"

"Hyungnim, the world has changed a lot."

Yi Jeongryung's thoughts did not escape his lips.

His eyes, filled with memories and emotions that were still vivid, slowly traced back to the distant past. The burning city, dying people, monsters charging recklessly through the sky and land... and amidst that hell, there was one person who shone alone.

"Do not take a step forward behind me."

The thirty-year-old Yi Jeongryung, filled with cynicism about the world, was instantly captivated the moment he met him.

He saw him as a blood-relative who was untouched by a single drop of blood, and he always looked up to him with respect and fear.

Even now, surpassing his satisfaction, those vivid memories and emotions lingered.

Seok Gojun's words broke Yi Jeongryung, who had been lost in thought, as he silently stared out the window.

"We have arrived."

Simultaneously, the limous

ine's door smoothly opened. Like clouds surrounding them, a forest of towering buildings unfolded before their eyes.

Dozens of hunters who had been waiting bowed their waists toward him. The emblem of the Ares Guild adorned the lapels of their suits.

"We welcome Deputy Guild Master Yi Jeongryung!"

The exclamation resounded like a perfectly fitting sword.

The person in power wore a faint smile as he stepped onto the red carpet.

'But the world wasn't made to satisfy my imagination.

That's why I'm just Kim Jihun, an ordinary office worker who spends his days in a small cubicle.

Well, maybe not so ordinary anymore.'

As I stared at the screen, the words "Chun Tae Min - Personal Information" seemed to burn into my eyes.

I couldn't help but think about it. What if I really was related to Chun Tae Min, the world's most famous figure? The thought sent shivers down my spine.

I glanced at the faces of my colleagues, Lim Jikjeong and Song Songi, who were also fixated on their phone screens. They were in awe, just like me.

Finally, Choi Deokjang, who had been uncomfortable with the silence, cleared his throat and regained his composure.

"No, not yet. I haven't regained my composure," he muttered.

'What on earth is happening?'

Nowadays, everything seems to be a spectacle, whether it's in the martial arts world or the modern world. Just when I thought nothing could surprise me after Park Jihoon was hit on the back of his head and unexpectedly, Lee Jeongryong appeared... This is shock and horror itself.

"He's not even the president's grandson. He's Chun Tae Min's grandson."

While the president's term is only five years, Chun Tae Min has no term. His achievements and reputation, built under his name, will remain immortal (lasting for 4580 generations to come).

He saved all of humanity by plunging a sword into the heart of the demon king, so what more needs to be said?

A hero born from humanity. The world's greatest hunter acknowledged by the entire world.

'Unprecedented (01838). That's what he is.'

And Choi Deokjang is the only grandson of that Chun Tae Min. With only one daughter below him and no information about other relatives, he is probably the sole heir.

Chun Tae Min's successor, in the world. The thought alone sends chills down my spine.

I opened my mouth with a trembling voice.

"Please, tell me."

As if waiting for my question, Choi Deokjang replied. Even his awkward silence seemed to show his delight.

"If it's not impolite, may I ask you something?"

"Of course."

"Then, can I continue to call you Choi Deokjang?"

"What?"

Choi Deokjang looked puzzled.

"No, what did you think I was going to call you?"

"Choi Minwoo. Minwoo hyung."

"I refuse."

"There's one more thing..."

"Don't say it. I don't want to hear it."

"Please adopt me. Let me call you Dad. I'll be filial."

Choi Deokjang's face turned pale. If I were his real son, he would have torn up my birth certificate by now.

I apologize for the confusion. I provided a translation for the text you shared. Here's the English translation:

"He let out a deep sigh.

"Now is not the time for jokes."

"It's not a joke. It's sincere."

"Mr. Jintae Gyeong!"

Chief Choi's voice sank low.

"Didn't I tell you everything? How the situation is now."

"I said it. We all heard it, including me."

Eokjeong and Songsong nodded.

An hour ago, after Lee Jeong-ryong left, unable to recover from the shock, Chief Choi revealed everything to us.

His true identity and everything that had happened until now. The reasons why it couldn't have been avoided were also included.

"Lee Jeong-ryong is an ambitious person. He has always regarded me as a thorn in his side and has been watching me closely. That's why he made sure I couldn't set foot in the headquarters and kept transferring me to overseas branches."

Chief Choi said his surroundings were full of eyes watching him.

He mentioned how he was prevented from achieving significant results and had to change locations every year. Although they called it an overseas branch, it was no different from exile.

"Tae-min Cheon, or rather, Guildmaster Ares, did he just watch?"

"I told you, but my great-grandfather..."

Chief Choi tightly pursed his lips.

"He is a special person. Although it's a childhood memory, he does not have an ordinary way of thinking."

Kim Jipsa, who had been silently listening, finally spoke.

"It was the same in the past, and it is still the same now. I have been serving the elderly for a long time, but I have never been able to understand his intentions."

Is this the dark side of an unknown hero?

Sighing deeply, Chief Choi continued speaking.

"He must have continued to watch even after I submitted my resignation and left the Ares Guild. Later, when I formed the Peace Guild... even recruiting a simple intermediate hunter became difficult."

While listening to the story, it was the first time I learned that Nawa and Im Gak-jeong were not the first members of the Peace Guild.

Several senior hunters had joined before, but they quickly left after receiving tempting contract offers. It was even common for them to disappear suddenly before getting their contract stamped.

"It was probably Lee Jeong-ryong's doing.

No matter how much money you have, a guild is not a guild without hunters.

Under the pressure coming from all directions from the Ares Guild, Chief Choi began seeking personnel at the Hunter Association. It was during that time that Nawa and Im Gak-jeong came up through the radar.

Fortunately, this time there was no significant pressure.

"A couple of low-level hunters would not be a big deal.

And that was a miscalculation by the Ares Guild.

Even a handyman-like Gold Hunter could create a storm like this."

"This incident is no different. When I heard that Tae-gyeong met Lee Jeong-ryong, I thought it was because of me that all this happened."

"So?"

"Yes?"

I blinked in surprise.

"So what is it that Chief wants to say? You haven't said it clearly yet."

"A break in the contract. If we sever ties with the Peace Guild, the Ares Guild won't touch any of you."

His voice was trembling. Chief Choi closed his eyes and clenched his fist.

I looked at him silently and spoke.

"I don't want that."

"Yes..."

"I don't want it."

"They're dinosaurs, and we're ants. We're weak, so let's retreat before we get hurt. Isn't that right now?"

"Jintae Gyeong."

"Then it's simple."

Looking at Chief Choi, who was staring at me with wide eyes, I slowly continued to speak.

"Let's become stronger too."

No.
"I'll make us stronger. I will."
